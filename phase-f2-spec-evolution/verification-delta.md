  - "1.17 (2026-07-22): Adversarial pass-14 remediation (P14-002 MAJOR / P14-005 MINOR) per architecture-delta v1.17 §8.30 items 8.30.6/8.30.7 (FV routing). **NAMESPACE DISCIPLINE (Lesson 8):** occupancy re-verified BEFORE allocation by `grep -rhoE 'VP-SKILL-[0-9]+' .factory/` (VP-SKILL max = 075) and `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` (max real = SM-53; SM-2026 is a date false-positive inside BC-6.01.001 frontmatter and SM-456 is the 'PRISM-456' charset example in BC-3.03.001 — neither a mutant); `grep -rn 'VP-SKILL-076\\|SM-54' .factory/` returned NO match before allocation (confirmed absent repo-wide incl. architecture-delta and the target file). VP-HOOK range confirmed 024–032 (max 032, unchanged this pass). Allocations: **VP-SKILL-076** (next-free VP-SKILL after 075 — the setup-time jira_project_key charset-validation VP, sibling of VP-SKILL-051 activate version-gate) and **SM-54** (next-free SM after SM-53). No existing VP/SM renumbered; no collisions. **(1) [P14-002 MAJOR — no-covering-VP] NEW VP-SKILL-076 — setup-time jira_project_key charset validation:** P13-002 added setup-time charset validation on the activate (BC-6.01.001 PC#12/EC-014) and onboard-customer (BC-6.01.003 Inv#6/EC-010) SKILL setup flows, but no VP covered it — only the RUNTIME command_pattern deny (VP-HOOK-032 PROJECT-KEY-CHARSET-DENY) was covered. VP-SKILL-076 is the PREVENTIVE setup-time gate: `activate` AND `onboard-customer` BOTH REJECT a `jira_project_key` not matching `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$` at SETUP time, with a user-facing error and NO partial-state write (fail-EARLY, not fail-closed mid-run); a conformant key (e.g. `PRISMDEMO`) is accepted. DISTINCT from VP-HOOK-032 (runtime disposition-guard command_pattern deny — a separate call-site VP-HOOK-032 does not exercise). Traces to BC-6.01.001 PC#12/EC-014 (activate) + BC-6.01.003 Inv#6/EC-010 (onboard-customer). Paired mutant **SM-54** (setup-time charset validation removed → a hyphenated key like `PRISM-DEMO` is stored → a downstream marker issuance then triggers the runtime `PROJECT-KEY-CHARSET-DENY` / `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` livelock — proving setup-time validation is not redundant with the runtime deny) killed by VP-SKILL-076's reject-at-setup vector. **(2) [P14-005 MINOR — VP repurposing annotation] VP-SKILL-053 / VP-SKILL-057 roster annotation:** VP-SKILL-053 originally covered onboard-customer AD-017 credential-provisioning; repurposed pass-14 (P14-005) → now idempotent directory creation (credential-provisioning acceptance coverage moves to VP-SKILL-076 / the BC-6.01.003 Inv#1 anchor, PO burst-10). VP-SKILL-057 originally covered sensor-metrics org_slug scoping; repurposed pass-9 (P9-005) → now sensor-metrics naming-compliance (D-DEC-006) — org_slug scoping for sensor-metrics is moot under the D-DEC-005 / P9-005 sensor-health carve-out (prism_sensor_health metadata is org_slug-exempt). Annotations added inline on both roster rows so a future audit sees the ID's meaning changed. **onboard-customer AD-017 coverage consequence:** BC-6.01.003 Inv#1 / EC-008 is now anchored by the PO's burst-10 anchor (see BC-6.01.003 Inv#1 — references VP-SKILL-054 pattern inheritance or the new VP-SKILL-076 setup-time gate). **(3) [NVD sweep, P14-001 propagation] CVSS-as-native_severity residual CORRECTED:** confirmed P11-003 already removed VP-HOOK-030's CVSS-float STEP-1a vector (line ~684), but a residual survived in VP-SKILL-074 (severity-normalization) and SM-44's killer-vector reference: NORMALIZE_SEVERITY is authoritative ONLY over sensor_family ∈ {crowdstrike, armis, claroty, cyberint} (P14-001 / D-DEC-013); NVD/CVSS is NOT a sensor_family and MUST NOT appear as a NORMALIZE_SEVERITY family/native_severity example; CVSS feeds `scored_priority` (field 18) at Stage 5. Removed the `CVSS 4.0/7.0/9.0` NORMALIZE_SEVERITY family boundaries from VP-SKILL-074 (§2 row, §6 note, §5 BC-10.01.001 row) and corrected SM-44's stale `(1)–(5)` / `CVSS 9.5+MEDIUM` reference to `(1)–(4)` (VP-HOOK-030 has four per-family SEVERITY-MISMATCH consistency vectors after P11-003). The §6 clean-separation claim ('no verification-delta vector now references NVD/CVSS as a native_severity source') is now TRUE. **(4)** VP count 35 → **36** (+VP-SKILL-076; no VP renumbered / re-scoped in place). Mutant count 47 → **48** (+SM-54). VP-SKILL now occupied 001–**076**, VP-HOOK 024–032, SM 9–**54** (SM-32 = 32a+32b+32-ext). Test-count ~258 → **~261** new BATS (net +3: +5 VP-SKILL-076 setup-time reject/accept on activate + onboard-customer, −2 VP-SKILL-074 CVSS boundary fixtures removed per the P14-001 NVD sweep). Live-BC post-pass-14 (PO-owned per architecture-delta §8.30, in parallel): BC-6.01.001 (activate PC#12/EC-014 setup-time validation) + BC-6.01.003 (onboard-customer Inv#6/EC-010 setup-time validation + Inv#1/EC-008 AD-017 VP anchor) — outside FV's edit scope; state-manager annotates spec-changelog [1.1.0]; §7 Part O records the FV cross-references. input-hash: COMPUTE-AT-COMMIT. Cross-doc/other-file version-ref reconciliation remains owned by the dedicated version-coherence sweep."
  - "1.16 (2026-07-22): Adversarial pass-13 remediation (P13-001 CRITICAL / P13-003 MAJOR / P13-004 MINOR) per architecture-delta v1.16 §8.29 FORMAL-VERIFIER LIST. **NAMESPACE DISCIPLINE (Lesson 8):** occupancy re-verified BEFORE allocation by `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` (max real = SM-51; SM-2026 is a date false-positive and SM-456 is the 'PRISM-456' example in BC-3.03.001, neither a mutant) and `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}' .factory/` (VP-SKILL max 075, VP-HOOK max 032); `grep -rn 'SM-52\\|SM-53' .factory/` returned NO match before allocation (confirmed absent repo-wide incl. architecture-delta and the target file). The architect used placeholder SM-P13-A (§8.29) — FV assigns the real id. Allocations: **SM-P13-A → SM-52** (revert P13-001 — the markdown FP branch issues an autonomous `[\"comment\"] marker; killed by the FP→allow-without-marker vector) and **SM-53** (NEW — disposition parse uses a full-document substring scan instead of the canonical-heading-anchored parse → a `Disposition: FP` string embedded in an evidence block/code fence is read as FP → wrongly allow-without-marker instead of review; killed by the FP-in-body/code-fence vector, P13-003). No existing VP/SM renumbered; VP-HOOK-031 UPDATED in place (no new id). **(1) [P13-001 CRITICAL — per human decision 2026-07-22] MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH ELIMINATED — VP-HOOK-031 guarantee (c) REWRITTEN:** the markdown path NO LONGER issues an autonomous `[\"comment\"]` marker for ANY disposition. Rationale (architecture-delta v1.16 §8.29 item 1 / D-DEC-008): the hook cannot evaluate scored_priority (field 18) or asset_type (field 14) from a 12-field markdown, and no known-FP store cross-check applies on this path — so P12-002's GATE 1 closed the TP/BTP masquerade but left a residual FP-branch that granted an autonomous comment marker with no scored_priority/asset_type floor enforcement (the exact class flagged by ADV-F2-P13-001). New routing after the markdown-evaluable floors pass: **FP → allow-without-marker** (Write succeeds; NO Jira action authorized; NO `[\"comment\"]` marker written — the analyst surfaces an FP comment via the review path or the normal 18-field verdict flow); **non-FP (TP/BTP/Indeterminate) / PARSE_FAIL → MARKDOWN_REVIEW_PATH** (create-review/comment-review, same STEP 3 semantics, EXEMPT from the kill switch). VP-HOOK-031 guarantee (c) is rewritten from 'disposition=FP + floors pass → comment marker' to 'NO disposition yields an autonomous [\"comment\"] marker from the markdown path — FP → allow-without-marker; non-FP/PARSE_FAIL → review marker.' The prior FP→comment-marker vector is RETIRED (reason 'MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH eliminated ADV-F2-P13-001'; history preserved, no re-run). Added vectors: markdown FP → allow-without-marker (NO comment marker written); markdown TP/BTP/Indeterminate → review marker; disposition PARSE_FAIL → review (NEVER allow-without-marker). Paired mutant **SM-52** (revert the elimination — FP markdown issues a `[\"comment\"]` marker) killed by the FP→allow-without-marker vector; DISTINCT from **SM-51** which remains VALID (SM-51 = remove the non-FP→review routing rule → a TP/BTP markdown wrongly gets allow-without-marker instead of review; killed by the TP→review vector). No double-meaning: SM-51 targets the non-FP→review routing branch; SM-52 targets the FP→allow-without-marker branch (reverting the comment-marker elimination). SM-50 (markdown kill-switch gate removal) also remains valid (killed by the FP-kill-switch vector). P11-004 human-analyst intent preserved: the analyst's Write is NOT denied; the FP comment now surfaces through the review flow rather than autonomous action. **(2) [P13-003 MAJOR] Parse-grammar adversarial vectors + SM-53:** added VP-HOOK-031 vectors for the strict parse grammar — negated-FP prose (`Disposition: not a false positive` / `Disposition: not FP — TP`) → PARSE_FAIL/non-FP → REVIEW (NOT read as FP); a `Disposition: FP` string inside a code fence / evidence block with no canonical Disposition heading → NOT matched (canonical-heading-anchored parse) → PARSE_FAIL → review; `autonomy_enabled: true` token embedded in an evidence block/quoted log → gate stays CLOSED (dedicated-structured-field-only parse) → allow-without-marker; plus the canonical-FP / canonical-long-form positive controls. Paired mutant **SM-53** (disposition parse uses a full-document substring scan → an embedded `Disposition: FP` in a code fence is read as FP → allow-without-marker instead of review) killed by the FP-in-body/negated-FP vectors. Since P13-001 eliminates MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH, the blast radius of a PARSE_FAIL is reduced (all non-FP outcomes route to review, not to an autonomous comment) — the grammar remains required to correctly distinguish allow-without-marker (canonical FP) from review (everything else incl. PARSE_FAIL). **(3) [P13-004 MINOR] Historical-total annotation:** the historical pass-9 blockquote (~line 244, '6 VP-HOOK (024–029) + 25 VP-SKILL … grand total 31') is annotated **[HISTORICAL — pass-9 snapshot, SUPERSEDED]**; the CURRENT grand total is **VP-HOOK 024–032 (9 hooks) + 26 VP-SKILL = 35 VPs** (see §2 Totals). Swept for other stale current-tense '6 VP-HOOK'/'31 VP' figures — none remain in the current body. **(4) PRISMDEMO sweep (P13-002 propagation):** all 17 current-body `PRISM-DEMO` vector/example references (§2 VP table, §4 SM catalog, §5, §6) corrected to `PRISMDEMO` (the hyphen-free Jira-conformant demo key; `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+$` / `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$` charset regexes UNCHANGED — correct-for-Jira; only the example values change). **(5)** VP count UNCHANGED at **35** (VP-HOOK-031 UPDATED in place — guarantee (c) rewrite + parse-grammar vectors; no new VP). Mutant count 45 → **47** (+SM-52, +SM-53; SM-50/SM-51 remain valid). Test-count ~342 → **~360** (net +~15 BATS on BC-3.03.001: VP-HOOK-031 P13-001 rewrite — FP→allow-without-marker (SM-52), TP/BTP/Indeterminate→review, PARSE_FAIL→review, FP-kill-switch (net +~4 after retiring the FP→comment vector) + parse-grammar adversarial vectors +~11 (SM-53); + ~3 parity → ~102 parity). Live-BC post-pass-13 (PO-owned per architecture-delta §8.28, in parallel): BC-3.03.001 (MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH elimination — FP→allow-without-marker; strict parse grammar; PC#2 prose update + cross-ref '(P11-004 / P12-002 / P13-001)'), BC-6.01.001 (activate) / BC-6.01.003 (onboard-customer) setup-time jira_project_key validation, brief PRISMDEMO rename (human-authorized) — all outside FV's edit scope; §7 Part N records the FV cross-references. input-hash: COMPUTE-AT-COMMIT. Cross-doc/other-file version-ref reconciliation remains owned by the dedicated version-coherence sweep."
  - "1.15 (2026-07-22): Adversarial pass-12 remediation (P12-001 CRITICAL / P12-002 CRITICAL / P12-003 MAJOR / P12-007 OBS) per architecture-delta v1.15 §8.27 FORMAL-VERIFIER LIST. **NAMESPACE DISCIPLINE (Lesson 8):** occupancy re-verified BEFORE allocation by `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` (max real = SM-47; SM-2026 is a date false-positive) and `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}' .factory/` (VP-SKILL max 075, VP-HOOK max 031); `grep -rn 'SM-48\\|SM-49\\|SM-50\\|SM-51\\|VP-HOOK-032' .factory/` returned NO match before allocation (confirmed absent repo-wide incl. architecture-delta). The architect used placeholders SM-P12-A/B/C/D (§8.27) — FV assigns the real ids. Allocations: **SM-P12-A → SM-48** (remove ticket_id charset-validation → `.*` authorizes an unrelated comment command), **SM-P12-B → SM-49** (remove jira_project_key charset-validation), **SM-P12-C → SM-50** (remove the markdown kill-switch gate), **SM-P12-D → SM-51** (remove the markdown disposition!=FP route-to-review rule → TP gets an autonomous comment marker); NEW **VP-HOOK-032** (next-free VP-HOOK after 031 — the O7 command_pattern interpolation-safety property). No existing VP/SM renumbered. **(1) [P12-001 CRITICAL — regex injection] NEW VP-HOOK-032 (the O7 compliance artifact):** in every marker path disposition-guard builds `command_pattern` by concatenating `ticket_id`/`jira_project_key` into an anchored regex that require-review later evaluates with `[[ =~ ]]`; those fields were charset-UNvalidated + un-escaped (only control-char-stripped for audit — P4-010), so a metacharacter-laden `ticket_id='.*'` / `'SEC-1 |.*#'` broadened the pattern to authorize an UNRELATED `jr issue comment` (SEC-009 class; defeats the anchored-match property). Fix (architecture-delta v1.15 D-DEC-012 O7 / §8.26.1): BEFORE interpolation, VALIDATE `ticket_id` against `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+$` (5 sites: STEP 6 comment/assign, STEP 3 comment-review, STEP 6 create [project-key], markdown comment path) and `jira_project_key` against `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$` (2 sites: STEP 3 create-review, STEP 6 create) → on mismatch write `TICKET-ID-CHARSET-DENY`/`PROJECT-KEY-CHARSET-DENY` audit entry + emit deny; regex-escape as defense-in-depth. VP-HOOK-032 asserts a metacharacter-laden value is DENIED BEFORE pattern construction at ALL interpolation sites + valid values pass and anchor correctly. Paired mutants **SM-48** (remove ticket_id validation → `.*` authorizes an unrelated comment; killed by the ticket_id charset-deny vectors) and **SM-49** (remove jira_project_key validation; killed by the project-key charset-deny vectors). The false D-DEC-001/D-DEC-008 'never derived from Jira ticket content' claim is corrected in the BCs (PO-owned) — ticket_id IS derived from content; metacharacter safety comes from charset-validation + escaping, not from a false provenance claim. NOT ASM-008-covered — a regex-safety bug latent since the original marker design. **(2) [P12-002 CRITICAL — markdown-path redesign] VP-HOOK-031 UPDATED (four-guarantee scope):** per human decision 2026-07-22 the Human-Comment Marker Path is redesigned; VP-HOOK-031 now covers ALL FOUR guarantees — (a) `autonomy_enabled` absent/≠true → allow-without-marker (no autonomous comment under the kill switch, matching STEP-5 semantics); (b) `disposition != FP` → route to create-review/comment-review (NOT an autonomous comment marker — the hook cannot evaluate scored_priority/asset_type from a 12-field markdown, so escalation-worthy TP/BTP surface to human review); (c) `disposition=FP` + all markdown-evaluable floors pass → comment marker; (d) `ticket_id` charset-validated on the markdown path (P12-001). Closes the autonomous-loop-masquerade bypass (the loop gains nothing by writing a TP as `investigation-*.md`). Paired mutants **SM-50** (remove the markdown kill-switch gate → autonomy=false TP markdown wrongly issues a comment marker; killed by the kill-switch vector) and **SM-51** (remove the disposition!=FP route-to-review rule → TP markdown gets an autonomous comment; killed by the TP→review vector). **(3) [P12-003 MAJOR — enum-map + floor exemption] VP-HOOK-025 / VP-HOOK-026 EXTENDED:** (a) the known-FP fast-path (Stage 5 bypassed) sets `scored_priority` from `NORMALIZE_SEVERITY` output {LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL} which is NOT a member of `SCORED_PRIORITY_ENUM` {CRIT,HIGH,MED,LOW} — a raw assignment produces `scored_priority='CRITICAL'`/`'MEDIUM'` → `validate_enums` fail-closed DENY of 30–40% of known-FP volume. VP-HOOK-025 gains fast-path enum-map vectors: the loop MUST map through `SEVERITY_TO_SCORED_PRIORITY_MAP` (CRITICAL→CRIT, MEDIUM→MED, HIGH→HIGH, LOW→LOW) so a mapped `CRIT`/`MED` passes validate_enums, while a raw unmapped `CRITICAL`/`MEDIUM` DENIES (the failure the map prevents). (b) VP-HOOK-026 gains the architectural known-FP floor-exemption vector: a documented known-FP + healthy sensor + non-forbidden technique + disposition=FP → auto-close (EC-009) even at high native severity, NOT routed to review (the known-FP store constitutes human pre-authorization). No new mutant for P12-003 (MAJOR, architect §8.27 item 3 — vectors only; the floor-exemption is architectural policy gated on PO confirming the BC-10.01.001 EC-009 floor-exempt annotation + known-FP store integrity invariants, §8.26.2). **(4) [P12-007 OBS] O7 standing rule codified in §0** (mirrors architecture-delta D-DEC-012 O7): any value interpolated into a `command_pattern` / authorization regex MUST be charset-validated to a fixed grammar (fail-closed) AND regex-escaped; every interpolation site needs a covering VP with a metacharacter-injection mutant. O7 interpolation audit: `ticket_id` (3 sites) + `jira_project_key` (2 sites) = 5 command_pattern sites, all covered by VP-HOOK-032 (SM-48/SM-49); `org_slug` is NOT interpolated into `command_pattern` (audit-log entries only, P4-010 control-char-strip sufficient) — SAFE, no command_pattern VP required. VP-HOOK-032 is the O7 compliance artifact (mirrors VP-HOOK-024=O5). **(5) Sweep:** no verification-delta current-body vector asserts the OLD markdown path (comment marker for ANY disposition) or the OLD fast-path raw `scored_priority` assignment — VP-HOOK-031 vector (a) re-cast from `Disposition: TP` to `Disposition: FP` (TP now routes to review) and the §5 BC-3.03.001 count updated; the D-DEC-001 'never derived from ticket content' claim does NOT appear in the verification-delta body (BC-owned, PO corrects). **(6)** VP count 34 → **35** (+VP-HOOK-032; VP-HOOK-031 updated in place, VP-HOOK-025/026 extended in place). Mutant count 41 → **45** (+SM-48, +SM-49, +SM-50, +SM-51). Test-count ~309 → **~342** (net +~25 BATS: BC-3.03.001 +23 [VP-HOOK-032 O7 charset +10, VP-HOOK-031 four-guarantee +6, VP-HOOK-025 fast-path enum-map +7] + BC-10.01.001 +2 [VP-HOOK-026 known-FP floor exemption]) + ~6 parity → ~99 parity. Live-BC post-pass-12 targets (PO-owned per architecture-delta §8.26, in parallel): BC-3.03.001 (ticket_id/jira_project_key charset-validation at 5 interpolation sites + markdown-path redesign + SEVERITY_TO_SCORED_PRIORITY_MAP note), BC-10.01.001 (fast-path enum map + known-FP floor exemption + store integrity), BC-4.05.001 (producer field rename — P12-004, PO-owned), BC-6.01.003/BC-8.02.001 (mis-anchor/traceability — P12-005/P12-006, PO-owned); §7 Part M records the FV cross-references. input-hash: COMPUTE-AT-COMMIT. Cross-doc/other-file version-ref reconciliation remains owned by the dedicated version-coherence sweep."
  - "1.14 (2026-07-22): Adversarial pass-11 remediation (P11-001 CRITICAL / P11-002 MAJOR / P11-003 MAJOR / P11-004 MAJOR) per architecture-delta v1.14 §8.25 FORMAL-VERIFIER LIST. **NAMESPACE DISCIPLINE (Lesson 8):** occupancy re-verified BEFORE allocation by `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` (max real = SM-45; SM-2026 is a date false-positive) and `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}' .factory/` (VP-SKILL max 075, VP-HOOK max 030); `grep -rn 'SM-46\\|SM-47\\|VP-HOOK-031' .factory/` returned NO match before allocation (confirmed absent repo-wide incl. architecture-delta). Allocations: **SM-46 / SM-47** (next free after SM-45) and **VP-HOOK-031** (next free VP-HOOK after 030); no existing VP/SM renumbered; two architect collision candidates (§8.25 SM-P11-A, unallocated VP) resolved to these next-free ids. **(1) [P11-001 CRITICAL] VP-HOOK-030 DOWNGRADED — consistency-only:** the pass-10 'un-bypassable / hook independently derives severity from raw sensor values / genuinely deterministic for severity' claim was FALSE — native_severity (field 16) and sensor_family (field 17) are BOTH written by the monitoring-loop LLM at Stage-1 INGEST and read verbatim; the network-free hook makes no prism call, so STEP 1a is a deterministic CONSISTENCY CHECK between two LLM-supplied fields, NOT ground-truth enforcement. VP-HOOK-030's asserted guarantee is re-scoped to 'verdict.severity is CONSISTENT with verdict.native_severity per the D-DEC-013 NORMALIZE_SEVERITY table (STEP 1a SEVERITY-MISMATCH check).' The SEVERITY-MISMATCH deny vectors are RETAINED (they still verify the consistency check) but their asserted guarantee is corrected. native_severity + sensor_family ground-truth is an **ASM-008-DEFERRED residual SYMMETRIC with the asset_type residual** (all three LLM-supplied; genuine enforcement requires a prism-signed field or hook-fetched prism data). VP-HOOK-030 stays FINALIZED as a consistency VP. **(2) [P11-002 MAJOR] scored_priority (field 18) two-field model:** verdict schema is now **18 mandatory fields** (12 ICD-203 + severity[13] + asset_type[14] + ticket_action_type[15] + native_severity[16] + sensor_family[17] + **scored_priority[18]**, enum CRIT|HIGH|MED|LOW = Stage-5 assess-priority output). The HIGH/CRIT hard floor now keys on `verdict.scored_priority` (field 18), NOT on recomputed severity — per brief §3.9 'any alert scored HIGH/CRIT → human,' capturing KEV/exposure/critical-asset escalations. VP-HOOK-026 gains scored_priority floor vectors (scored_priority∈{HIGH,CRIT} → hard floor → review path, NO regular marker; INCLUDING detector severity=LOW + scored_priority=CRIT → floor fires) and a field-18 validation vector (missing/invalid scored_priority → deny) is added to VP-HOOK-025. Paired mutant **SM-46** (re-key the floor back to recomputed severity instead of scored_priority) killed by the detector-LOW/scored-CRIT vector. scored_priority is itself LLM-supplied (same ASM-008-class residual — NOT asserted as ground-truth). All current-body '17-field' references swept to 18 (historical/changelog/snapshot narrative left intact). **(3) [P11-003 MAJOR] NVD/CVSS clean separation:** native_severity + sensor_family always describe the ORIGINATING SENSOR's raw reading; NVD/CVSS enrichment influences scored_priority (Stage-5), NOT native_severity; sensor_family has no `nvd` member. VP-HOOK-030's former CVSS-float STEP-1a under-report vector (5) is REMOVED (CVSS is not a hook-checked native_severity source). **(4) [P11-004 MAJOR] NEW VP-HOOK-031 — separate human-comment marker path:** the 12-field investigation-markdown path does NOT enter the verdict emitter; it emits a comment-scoped marker gated ONLY on 12-field completeness + markdown-evaluable hard floors (Indeterminate disposition, forbidden techniques, degraded/silent sensor), NOT validate_enums/STEP-1a. Vectors: (a) compliant 12-field save → comment marker, Write NOT denied; (b) Indeterminate/forbidden-technique/degraded-sensor → MARKDOWN-HARD-FLOOR deny; (c) a 12-field markdown gets NO validate_enums/STEP-1a (no false enum deny for absent verdict-only fields, incl. scored_priority). Paired mutant **SM-47** (route the 12-field markdown into the verdict emitter) killed by vectors (c)/(a). **(5) [P11-001/P11-002] O6 §0 annotation EXTENDED:** a hook re-computation from LLM-supplied inputs is a CONSISTENCY CHECK, not ground-truth enforcement; a network-free hook needs a prism-signed or hook-fetched input for true O6 (ASM-008-DEFERRED); the high-severity floor is moved to scored_priority (same residual class). **(6)** VP count 33 → **34** (+VP-HOOK-031; VP-HOOK-030 downgraded in place, VP-HOOK-025/026 extended in place). Mutant count 39 → **41** (+SM-46, +SM-47). Test-count ~297 → **~309** (net +~9 BATS: VP-HOOK-026 scored_priority floor +4 [incl. detector-LOW/scored-CRIT, SM-46] + VP-HOOK-025 field-18 validation +1 on BC-3.03.001/BC-10.01.001; VP-HOOK-031 human-comment marker path +4 [SM-47] on BC-3.03.001) + ~3 parity → ~93 parity.

VP-HOOK-030 adds per-family under-report vectors (CrowdStrike numeric, Armis/Claroty bands, Cyberint, NVD/CVSS) → deny; known-good agreement → proceed; missing field 16 or 17 → STEP 1 enum/presence deny. Paired mutant **SM-44** (revert STEP 1a — trust verdict.severity directly) killed by the under-report vectors. Housed as a NEW VP-HOOK (not folded into VP-HOOK-029) because STEP 1a is a distinct enforcement mechanism (trust-basis / O6), sibling to VP-HOOK-025 (enum) and VP-HOOK-026 (hard-floor). **(2) [P10-002 MAJOR] NEW VP-SKILL-075 — operator-boundary cron-exit-nonzero signal:** the cron wrapper (run-monitoring-loop.sh) exits non-zero (Gate 2) when markers/audit.log contains HARD-FLOOR-LIVELOCK-ABORT | HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE | UNDER-LABEL-DENIED | SEVERITY-MISMATCH | MARKER-WRITE-FAILED newer than run-start; exits 0 on a clean run. **ASM-015-BLOCKED leg:** the Gate-1 assertion (hook-deny → .permission_denials populated in the --allowedTools JSON envelope) is BLOCKED pending ASM-015 empirical validation — that leg is marked ASM-015-PENDING and NOT counted toward convergence until ASM-015 resolves; the audit.log Gate-2 legs are testable NOW.

No existing VP/SM renumbered. **(1) [P9-004 MINOR — bookkeeping, MY doc, fixed directly] §2 Totals VP-split mislabel + lifecycle-label drift:** the §2 Totals narrative claimed '8 hook properties / 23 skill properties' but the roster contains **6 VP-HOOK (024–029)** and **25 VP-SKILL** (050, 051, 052–063 [12], 064–074 [11]); grand total 31 is correct — the 8/23 split label was an internal miscount. Corrected to **6 hook / 25 skill**. Separately, the §2 Totals called VP-SKILL-052–063 'FINALIZED' while the §1 Namespace Adjudication table (the authoritative per-VP lifecycle table, and the source of truth absent a VP-INDEX.md) marks 052–063 as **ACCEPTED** (F1-inherited, never re-adjudicated/FINALIZED in F2 — only 050/051 are FINALIZED F1 VPs; F2 FINALIZES specific new ids like 064/069/070). The §1 label (ACCEPTED) is correct; the §2 'FINALIZED proposed' label was the drift. Reconciled §2 Totals to **'12 ACCEPTED F1-inherited VPs (052–063)'** — both locations now read ACCEPTED. **(2) [P9-001 MAJOR] VP-HOOK-024 — escaped-quote differential-vs-bash partition (O5):** the P8-002 quote-aware tokenizer toggles state on EVERY `\\\"`/`\\'` regardless of a preceding backslash, diverging from bash for the backslash-escape class; P8-003 removed the step-5 backstop, so step-6a `structural_label_check` is the SOLE anti-fungibility gate (EC-023 direction A). Added the escaped-quote partition per O5: **(1a SECURITY)** a command with a backslash-escaped quote boundary hiding a REAL trailing `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` (e.g. `--summary \"a\\\"b\" --label REVIEW-REQUIRED`) → the D-DEC-001 v1.12 backslash-aware tokenizer keeps IN_DOUBLE across `\\\"` so the real `--label` is a standalone token → `has_review_label=TRUE` → a `[\"create\"]` marker is **DENIED** (bypass prevented); **(1b)** an escaped quote INSIDE the `--summary` value with NO real trailing label → `has_review_label=FALSE` → **ALLOW** (false-deny prevention); plus a **partition-2** completeness vector (`\\'` in UNQUOTED → literal apostrophe, no IN_SINGLE state entered, a subsequent whitespace-preceded `--label` is correctly detected) so the partition covers all backslash-escape classes the jr surface honors per O5. New mutant **SM-43** (revert the D-DEC-001 IN_DOUBLE backslash handling to the P8-002 toggle-on-every-quote behavior → `\\\"` closes the quoted region, the real `--label` is hidden, has_review_label=FALSE, the `[\"create\"]` marker wrongly ALLOWs the review-labeled create) killed by vector 1a; separately killable from SM-42 (non-quote-aware `split_on_whitespace` revert) and SM-40 (raw-substring revert). **Equals-form (`--label=REVIEW-REQUIRED`) SCOPED OUT** — jr CLI does not support the equals form (`jr issue create --help`, confirmed 2026-07-21); only `--label VALUE` space-separated form is emitted. Documented in VP-HOOK-024 with a re-evaluate note. **(3) [P9-007 MINOR] VP-HOOK-029 — dedup-before-fallback vector (test-only):** added a vector asserting the STEP-3 comment-review→create-review fallback hint (comment-review + null `ticket_id` + `jira_project_key` present) instructs the loop to re-run the §3.4 BLIND-SPOT/REVIEW-REQUIRED dedup query BEFORE switching to create-review — a dedup HIT (existing open review ticket) MUST NOT produce a duplicate create-review ticket (D-DEC-004 one-open-ticket). No new mutant warranted (architect §8.21 item 2 — the change is in the deny-reason text, not a security-critical control-flow path); documented as a test-only coverage vector. The loop-side dedup-HIT→comment-not-create protection is discharged by the existing **VP-SKILL-068** (grace-window + Jira-first dedup). **(4) [P9-009 OBS] O5 standing rule codified in §0** (mirrors architecture-delta v1.12 §D-DEC-012 O3-table O5 row): any hook re-implementing shell tokenization for a security decision MUST carry a differential-vs-bash vector partition over all shell-quoting classes the downstream CLI honors, with paired mutants; VP-HOOK-024 is the O5 compliance artifact for `structural_label_check`. **(5)** Mutant count 36 → **37** (+SM-43; no re-target/renumber); VP count UNCHANGED at **31** (VP-HOOK-024 / VP-HOOK-029 extended in place).

Added three vectors: (a) hard-floor verdict + create-review + null/empty `jira_project_key` → verdict Write DENIED + `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` audit naming `missing_field=jira_project_key`, NEVER a silent allow-without-marker; (b) hard-floor + comment-review + null `ticket_id` + `jira_project_key` present → DENIED with a create-review fallback hint in the corrective reason; (c) hard-floor + comment-review + BOTH bindings null → DENIED naming both missing fields. New mutant **SM-41** (revert the STEP-3 create-review null-`jira_project_key` branch to emit-allow-without-marker → the pre-P8-001 silent-discard) killed by vectors (a)–(c); separately killable from SM-38 (which reverts the STEP-4 under-label deny). **(2) [P8-002 MAJOR] VP-HOOK-024 — quote-aware tokenizer:** the P7-005 `structural_label_check` (`split_on_whitespace`) still false-denies EC-024's own quoted-`--summary` example (the hook receives the raw command string with literal quotes via `jq -r`, no shell expansion). The false-deny-prevention vector is updated to the QUOTED form explicitly — a `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` literal INSIDE a double-quoted `--summary` value → `has_review_label=false` → ALLOW under the D-DEC-001 state-machine tokenizer (UNQUOTED/IN_SINGLE/IN_DOUBLE). New mutant **SM-42** (revert `structural_label_check` to non-quote-aware `split_on_whitespace`) killed by the quoted-form vector; SEPARATELY killable from **SM-40** (raw-substring revert) — documented distinction: SM-40 dies because the raw substring matches inside the quoted region; SM-42 dies because whitespace-splitting breaks the quoted `--summary` value into a standalone `--label` token immediately preceding `REVIEW-REQUIRED`. **(3) [P8-003 MINOR] EC-023 / step-5 correction:** bash `[[ =~ ]]` is NOT tail-anchored — the regular create pattern `^jr … issue create --project KEY( |$)` PASSES step 5 for a review-labeled `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED …` command (`( |$)` guards ONLY against project-KEY prefix extension, e.g. `PROD` ≠ `PRODUCTION`). Anti-fungibility direction A is therefore enforced EXCLUSIVELY at step 6a (`structural_label_check`); there is NO step-5 'structural defense-in-depth' backstop. Swept the doc for any step-5-rejects-review-labeled-create / defense-in-depth-at-step-5 claim (none present as a current-body assertion — the claim lives in BC-3.01.001 EC-023, PO-owned §8.18); the §6 false-deny note re-cast to make step 6a the SOLE anti-fungibility enforcement point and load-bearing. Step 6a is a single point of failure → the SM-36/37/40/42 step-6a mutant family is **P0-adjacent** (SM-36/37 remain CRITICAL; the family is now NON-REDUNDANT and MUST be killed at the ≥95% require-review bar — no step-5 redundancy remains). **(4) Stale sweep:** the STEP-3 'allow without marker' missing-binding behavior was never encoded as a CURRENT-body assertion in verification-delta (it lived only in the BC/architecture bodies), so no residual current-body references required correction; the retired pass-5 'error-artifact+deny when no jira_project_key / UNDER-LABEL-CORRECTED' reference in the historical §7 Part F propagation ledger is left intact (superseded by Part H per the append-only-ledger convention). **(5)** Mutant count 34 → **36** (+SM-41, +SM-42; no re-target/renumber); VP count UNCHANGED at **31** (VP-HOOK-029 / VP-HOOK-024 extended in place).

(5) [P6-007 MINOR] Added **VP-SKILL-073** (late-event drop detection, D-DEC-002) — event `_time < watermark − WATERMARK_GRACE_SECONDS` → LATE_EVENT_DETECTED audit entry emitted, event still processed; never a silent drop. Tag P1, PROPOSED. (6) Swept the CURRENT body for the STEP 4/5 swap (under-label upgrade = STEP 4, kill switch = STEP 5, post ADV-F2-P6-002): SM catalog target labels (SM-16, SM-32a, SM-33), VP-HOOK-026/029 rows, §3/§6 present-tense discussions; stale create-review command_pattern updated to the `--label (REVIEW-REQUIRED|BLIND-SPOT)( |$)`-in-fixed-second-position form; stale 'zero jr writes' phrasing re-scoped. (7) Mutant count 28 → **31** (SM-9..SM-35 with SM-32=SM-32a+SM-32b+SM-32-ext, + SM-36, + SM-37). VP count 29 → **31** (+VP-SKILL-073, +VP-SKILL-074).

Live-BC snapshot at v1.9 edit time (pass-6): BC-3.01.001 v1.17→**v1.18**, BC-3.03.001 v1.13→**v1.15**, BC-10.01.001 v1.9→**v1.11** (STEP reorder + Inv#11 carve-out + severity normalization body owned by PO per architecture-delta §8.14; FV cross-refs in §7 Part G).

  - "1.8 (2026-07-21): Adversarial pass-5 re-scope (ADV-F2-P5-001 CRITICAL / P5-002 MAJOR) per architecture-delta v1.8 §8.13 FORMAL-VERIFIER LIST. Root cause (§8.13 / D-DEC-012 O3 standing rule): the deterministic disposition-guard hook trusted the LLM-supplied ticket_action_type without cross-checking hook-computed hard_floor_applies(); P5-001 (under-label) and P5-002 (over-label) are the duals of that single gap. (1) [P5-001 CRITICAL] RE-SCOPED VP-HOOK-029 from the happy-path-only 'hard-floor verdict WITH ticket_action_type∈{create-review,comment-review} → marker OR error' (which could NOT detect the silent-discard case) to the fail-loud critical vectors: 'hard-floor verdict carrying a NON-review ticket_action_type∈{comment,create,assign,none} → review-marker (STEP 5 upgrade) XOR explicit error+deny — NEVER silent allow-without-marker.' New vectors cover all three STEP 5 branches — (a) ticket_id present → comment-review upgrade; (b) ticket_id null + jira_project_key present → create-review upgrade; (c) ticket_id null + project_key absent → error artifact + deny — plus the UNDER-LABEL-CORRECTED audit entry; the pre-existing correct-label happy-path vectors are RETAINED (§8.13 item 1). (2) [P5-001/P5-002] RE-SCOPED SM-32 into two separately-killable variants: SM-32a (remove STEP 5 under-label upgrade → silent emit-allow-without-marker) killed by VP-HOOK-029 under-label vectors; SM-32b (remove the STEP 3 'NOT hard_floor_applies()' over-label gate → non-hard-floor verdict with a review token gets the kill-switch/hard-floor-exempt marker) killed by VP-HOOK-026 over-label vectors. Mutant count 27 → 28 (SM-9..SM-35, SM-32=SM-32a+SM-32b). (3) [P5-002 MAJOR] EXTENDED VP-HOOK-026 with over-label legs: a non-hard-floor verdict (disposition=TP, LOW severity, standard asset) carrying a create-review/comment-review token produces NO marker (allow-without-marker), incl. under autonomy_enabled=false (no kill-switch bypass) — the STEP 3 exemption is now GATED on hook-computed hard_floor_applies(verdict)=TRUE. (4) Swept §3 review-surfacing discussion, §5 BC-10.01.001 counts, and §6 notes for the retired 'unconditional/ungated review-exemption' and 'silent allow on action==none under hard floor' semantics; aligned to the STEP 3 gate + STEP 5 fail-loud upgrade (architecture-delta v1.8 D-DEC-008 STEP 3/STEP 5). VP namespace UNCHANGED (VP-SKILL 001–072, VP-HOOK 024–029; SM 9–35) — re-scope, NOT new IDs. Kill-switch Option A (escalation markers execute under autonomy_enabled=false for GENUINE hard-floor verdicts, human-confirmed 2026-07-21) reflected in the gated exemption. Test-count estimate ~231 → ~238 (+7 BATS on BC-10.01.001: VP-HOOK-026 over-label gate +3, VP-HOOK-029 fail-loud under-label expansion +4)."

## 0. Standing Rules / Conventions (cross-cutting, load-bearing)

**O4 standing rule — consumer-boundary evidence (ADV-F2-P7-009 / architecture-delta v1.10 D-DEC-012
O3 table row P7-009).** *Emitter-local artifacts NEVER suffice as evidence for a consumer-boundary
guarantee.* A marker file existing in the store, or an audit line being written, is an **emitter-side**
predicate; the human-surface guarantee (a finding reaches a SOC analyst) lives at the **consumer/Bash
boundary** — a `jr` write is authorized AND consumable. **Every "never silently discarded" / fail-loud
claim in this document MUST be discharged by a VP whose assertion is the downstream jr
authorization/execution outcome, not the upstream marker presence.** An emitter-only VP cannot detect
the Write→Bash seam gap (the exact class of defect P7-001 surfaced: a marker present in the store but
structurally unconsumable by the loop's own command). This rule is operationalized by the VP-HOOK-029
re-scope (§2 / §6) and governs all future fail-loud VP authoring for this cycle. (The O1–O3 standing
rules — enum-membership before routing, LLM-supplied routing fields cross-validated against
hook-computed invariants, consumer-consumption/ordering/trust-boundary coverage — remain in force per
architecture-delta D-DEC-012.)

**O5 standing rule — differential-vs-bash tokenization partition (ADV-F2-P9-009 / architecture-delta v1.12
D-DEC-012 O3 table row P9-009).** *Any hook that re-implements shell tokenization to make a security
decision MUST carry a differential-vs-bash vector partition covering all shell-quoting classes the
downstream CLI honors.* Whenever a hook parses a raw command string to derive a security predicate (rather
than delegating to a real shell parser), its tokenizer WILL diverge from bash for some quoting class unless
proven otherwise; each divergence is a potential false-allow (security bypass) or false-deny. The partition
MUST include: **(a)** a vector for each quoting class the CLI command surface uses — single-quoted,
double-quoted, backslash-escaped (`\"`/`\'`), and unquoted; **(b)** paired mutants demonstrating that
divergence from bash tokenization is detectable and killable by the VP. This is operationalized for the
`structural_label_check` control by **VP-HOOK-024** (the O5 compliance artifact): P8-002 covered the
bare-quote classes; P9-001 (v1.12) extends the partition to the backslash-escape class (SM-43). **Any future
change to `structural_label_check`, or any new CLI flag added to the monitored command surface, MUST extend
this partition (with a paired mutant) BEFORE the change is merged.** The `--label=VALUE` equals form is
explicitly SCOPED OUT of the partition because jr does not support it (`jr issue create --help`, confirmed
2026-07-21) — re-evaluate if jr adds equals-form support.

**O6 standing rule — inputs to a hook-computed invariant must be hook-recomputable / hook-cross-validated
(ADV-F2-P10-001 / architecture-delta v1.13 D-DEC-012 O3 table row P10-001).** *The inputs to a hook-computed
invariant MUST themselves be hook-recomputable or hook-cross-validated against a deterministic ground truth —
they must NOT be merely accepted from the LLM-written verdict.* An invariant computed exclusively from
LLM-supplied fields is **not** a deterministic enforcement surface: an attacker-influenced LLM can under-report
the input (e.g. `severity="LOW"` for a genuinely CRITICAL alert) so the hook computes the invariant from the
manipulated value and the control is silently circumvented. The remediation pattern is: **(a)** carry the raw
source data verbatim from the producing stage into the verdict as REQUIRED fields (`native_severity` field 16,
`sensor_family` field 17, carried from Stage-1 INGEST); **(b)** the hook re-runs the deterministic computation
(the D-DEC-013 `NORMALIZE_SEVERITY` table) and cross-checks the LLM-reported result; **(c)** mismatch → **deny**.
This is operationalized for the severity dimension by **VP-HOOK-030** (disposition-guard STEP 1a
`SEVERITY-MISMATCH`, the O6 compliance artifact).

**O6 residual annotation (ADV-F2-P11-001 CRITICAL — extended form).** The pass-10 framing that STEP 1a
relocated severity trust "from the LLM to the hook" and made the floor "un-bypassable" was OVERSTATED, and
this document's earlier "genuinely deterministic for severity / hook independently recomputes it from raw
sensor values" language is WITHDRAWN. `native_severity` (field 16) and `sensor_family` (field 17) are BOTH
written by the monitoring-loop LLM at Stage-1 INGEST and read verbatim by disposition-guard; the hook makes
**no prism call** (network-free, per BC-3.01.001 Invariant #2). **A hook re-computation from LLM-supplied
inputs is a CONSISTENCY CHECK, not ground-truth enforcement:** STEP 1a can only prove that `verdict.severity`
agrees with `NORMALIZE_SEVERITY(verdict.native_severity, verdict.sensor_family)` — it CANNOT detect an
adversarial LLM that supplies a false `native_severity`/`sensor_family` pair. True O6 (ground-truth
enforcement) for a network-free hook requires a **prism-signed severity field or hook-fetched prism data** —
both **ASM-008-DEFERRED** pre-production follow-ups. The residual is therefore SYMMETRIC across three
LLM-supplied hard-floor inputs, none of which is currently ground-truth-enforced:
(a) `native_severity`/`sensor_family` — STEP 1a is consistency-only (VP-HOOK-030 downgraded, P11-001);
(b) `asset_type` — enum-membership enforced NOW, `prism_asset_class` cross-validation ASM-008-DEFERRED;
(c) `scored_priority` (field 18) — the HIGH/CRIT hard-floor key as of P11-002, also LLM-supplied (assess-priority
is an LLM skill). **Any future hook invariant whose inputs are LLM-derived MUST apply O6** — either carry the
raw source + recompute (a consistency check, whose residual MUST be documented as ASM-008-class), or
cross-validate against a hook-observable ground truth (prism-signed / hook-fetched), with a paired mutant
proving an input-trust regression is detectable. No "un-bypassable" / "independently derived" claim may be
made for a network-free hook whose inputs are LLM-supplied.

**O7 standing rule — command_pattern / authorization-regex interpolation safety (ADV-F2-P12-007 /
architecture-delta v1.15 D-DEC-012 O3 table row P12-007).** *Any value interpolated into a `command_pattern`
(or any authorization regex a hook later evaluates with `[[ =~ ]]`) MUST be charset-validated to a fixed
grammar (fail-closed DENY on mismatch) AND regex-escaped as defense-in-depth BEFORE interpolation; every such
interpolation site MUST have a covering VP with a metacharacter-injection mutant.* A value concatenated into an
anchored authorization regex without charset-validation can alter the pattern's metacharacter structure —
`ticket_id='.*'` broadens `^jr … issue comment <ticket_id> ` to match ANY comment command, and
`ticket_id='SEC-1 |.*#'` injects an alternation that matches arbitrary commands (the SEC-009 unanchored/broadened-match
class). Control-char stripping (`tr -d '\000-\037'`, P4-010) is NOT sufficient — it does not strip the regex
metacharacters `. * + ? | ( ) [ ] ^ $ \`. The remediation pattern is: **(a)** validate the field against its fixed
Jira-key grammar (`ticket_id` ↦ `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+$`; `jira_project_key` ↦ `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$`) and emit a
`TICKET-ID-CHARSET-DENY` / `PROJECT-KEY-CHARSET-DENY` deny on mismatch; **(b)** regex-escape the validated value
before concatenation; **(c)** a VP asserting a metacharacter-laden value cannot broaden the pattern, with a paired
mutant that removes the validation. This is operationalized by **VP-HOOK-032** (the O7 compliance artifact for
`command_pattern` construction, sibling to VP-HOOK-024 = the O5 compliance artifact for `structural_label_check`).
**O7 interpolation audit (as of P12-001/P12-007 — the 5 `command_pattern` interpolation sites):** `ticket_id`
at STEP 6 comment, STEP 6 assign, and the markdown comment path (3 `ticket_id` sites); `jira_project_key` at
STEP 3 create-review and STEP 6 create (2 `jira_project_key` sites) — plus `ticket_id` at STEP 3 comment-review —
**ALL covered by VP-HOOK-032** (SM-48 for `ticket_id`, SM-49 for `jira_project_key`). `org_slug` is **NOT**
interpolated into any `command_pattern` (it appears only in audit-log entries where the P4-010 control-char-strip
is sufficient) — **audit-only / SAFE**, so O7 does NOT require a `command_pattern` VP for `org_slug` unless a
future change introduces it into pattern construction. **Any future interpolation site added after this pass
requires a new O7 VP entry (with a paired metacharacter-injection mutant) BEFORE the feature is considered
architecturally complete.**

## 1. Namespace Adjudication (independent re-verification)

The F1 audit reported occupancy `VP-SKILL 001–049`, `VP-HOOK ≤023`. I re-verified independently
by globbing every BC in `.factory/phase-0-ingestion/behavioral-contracts/` and mapping each
new VP ID to its owning file. **v1.1 added VP-SKILL-064 (ADV-F2-008) and VP-SKILL-065
(ADV-F2-019). v1.2 added VP-SKILL-066/067/068 + VP-HOOK-027 + SM-26/27/28. v1.3 (this edit)
re-verified occupancy independently against the LIVE BCs by `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}'`
across every BC — max in-BC `VP-SKILL` = 070 (BC-5.01.001 references VP-SKILL-069 PROPOSED;
BC-4.05.001 references VP-SKILL-070 PROPOSED), max `VP-HOOK` = 027, `SM` catalog max = 28. v1.3
FINALIZES the two already-PROPOSED ids (VP-SKILL-069 in BC-5.01.001, VP-SKILL-070 in BC-4.05.001 —
exactly as the BCs cite them) and appends VP-SKILL-071 (next free 071, confirmed absent repo-wide
outside architecture-delta) + VP-HOOK-028 (next free 028, confirmed absent repo-wide) + SM-29/30.
VP-SKILL is now occupied 001–071, VP-HOOK 024–028, SM 9–30; ZERO collisions confirmed
independently.**

**v1.5 (this edit) re-verified occupancy independently against the LIVE pass-4 BCs by
`grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}'` across every BC — max in-BC `VP-SKILL` = 071, max
`VP-HOOK` = 028, `SM` catalog max = 30. `VP-SKILL-072`, `VP-HOOK-029`, and `SM-31..SM-35` are
confirmed absent from every BC (VP-HOOK-029 appears ONLY as a `(proposed)` forward-reference in

**v1.9 (this edit) re-verified occupancy independently against the LIVE pass-6 BCs and the
architecture-delta v1.9 body by `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}'` and `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+'`
across `.factory/`. Two collisions in the architect's §8.15 proposal were caught and corrected —
the FV owns the VP/SM namespace and must never collide:**
1. **Severity normalization — architect §8.15 item 3 said "VP-SKILL-072", but VP-SKILL-072 is
   OCCUPIED** (first-run 24h lookback, FINALIZED v1.5 / BC-10.01.001 v1.9 Inv#13). The architect's
   own body (§660, §3541) commits **VP-SKILL-073** to late-event detection, so severity normalization
   takes the next free id **VP-SKILL-074**. Late-event detection stays **VP-SKILL-073** (as the
   architecture body already cites). Correction noted; no existing VP disturbed.
2. **Consumer anti-fungibility mutants — architect §8.15 item 5 (and the same-named consumer mutants)
   said "SM-33"/"SM-34", but SM-33 (autonomy_enabled-clause-removed) and SM-34 (dispatch-order-inverted)
   are OCCUPIED pass-4 sentinels** (killed by VP-HOOK-026 / VP-HOOK-028 respectively). The consumer
   STEP 6a anti-fungibility mutants take the next free ids **SM-36** (remove the review-label check for
   review markers) and **SM-37** (remove the reverse check for regular markers). **SM-32-ext**
   (revert the STEP 4/5 ordering) is a safe SM-32-family sub-variant (no top-level collision).
VP-SKILL is now occupied 001–074, VP-HOOK 024–029, SM 9–37 (SM-32 = 32a+32b+32-ext); ZERO collisions
confirmed independently.

**v1.10 (this edit — pass-7) re-verified occupancy independently before allocating any new SM id
(Lesson 8): `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` returns max real = SM-37 (SM-2026 is a DATE false-positive
inside BC-6.01.001 frontmatter, not a mutant), and `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}'` returns
VP-SKILL max 074, VP-HOOK max 029. The architect's §8.17 placeholders SM-NEW-A / SM-NEW-B take the next
free ids **SM-38 / SM-39**; the step-6a paired mutant takes **SM-40**. No new VP id is minted (VP-HOOK-029
re-scoped in place; VP-HOOK-024 / VP-SKILL-074 extended). SM is now occupied 9–40 (SM-32 = 32a+32b+32-ext;
SM-32a re-targeted, SM-32-ext kill vector re-worded — neither changes the id set); VP-SKILL 001–074,
VP-HOOK 024–029. ZERO collisions confirmed independently.**

**v1.11 (this edit — pass-8) re-verified occupancy independently before allocating any new SM id
(Lesson 8): `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` returns max real = **SM-40** (SM-2026 is still the DATE
false-positive inside BC-6.01.001 frontmatter, not a mutant), and `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}'`
returns VP-SKILL max 074, VP-HOOK max 029. The architect's §8.19 placeholders SM-P8-A / SM-P8-B take the
next free ids **SM-41 / SM-42** (both confirmed absent repo-wide, including in the target file, before
allocation). No new VP id is minted — VP-HOOK-029 is EXTENDED in place with the P8-001 unbindable-deny
vectors (it stays FINALIZED P0; additive to the §8.17 deny-path set, not a re-scope), and VP-HOOK-024 is
EXTENDED with the P8-002 quote-aware vector/mutant. SM is now occupied 9–42 (SM-32 = 32a+32b+32-ext);
VP-SKILL 001–074, VP-HOOK 024–029. ZERO collisions confirmed independently.**

**v1.12 (this edit — pass-9) re-verified occupancy independently before allocating any new SM id
(Lesson 8): `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` returns max real = **SM-42** (SM-2026 is still the DATE
false-positive inside BC-6.01.001 frontmatter, not a mutant), and `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}'`
returns VP-SKILL max 074, VP-HOOK max 029. The architect's §8.21 placeholder SM-P9-A takes the next free
id **SM-43** (`grep -rn 'SM-43' .factory/` returned no match before allocation — confirmed absent
repo-wide, including in the target file). No new VP id is minted — VP-HOOK-024 is EXTENDED in place with
the P9-001 escaped-quote differential-vs-bash partition (+SM-43), and VP-HOOK-029 is EXTENDED with the
P9-007 dedup-gate test-only vector (no mutant — architect §8.21 item 2). SM is now occupied 9–43 (SM-32 =
32a+32b+32-ext); VP-SKILL 001–074, VP-HOOK 024–029. ZERO collisions confirmed independently.**

**v1.13 (this edit — pass-10) re-verified occupancy independently before allocating any new VP/SM id
(Lesson 8): `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` returns max real = **SM-43** (SM-2026 is still the DATE
false-positive inside BC-6.01.001 frontmatter, not a mutant); `grep -rhoE 'VP-(SKILL|HOOK)-[0-9]{3}' .factory/`
returns VP-SKILL max 074, VP-HOOK max 029. The architect used placeholders **SM-P10-A / SM-P10-B** and
UNALLOCATED VP placeholders (§8.23) — FV assigns the real ids. `grep -rn 'SM-44\|SM-45\|VP-HOOK-030\|VP-SKILL-075' .factory/`
returned NO match before allocation (confirmed absent repo-wide, INCLUDING architecture-delta and the target
file). Allocations: **SM-P10-A → SM-44** (next free after SM-43), **SM-P10-B → SM-45**; **VP-HOOK-030** (next
free VP-HOOK after 029 — STEP 1a SEVERITY-MISMATCH, P10-001), **VP-SKILL-075** (next free VP-SKILL after 074 —
operator-boundary cron-exit, P10-002). VP-HOOK-029 is EXTENDED in place (P10-003 marker-write fail-closed,
+SM-45), VP-SKILL-059 UPGRADED in place (P10-005 structural→behavioral), VP-SKILL-064 RENAMED/extended in place
(P10-006/P10-007). No existing VP/SM renumbered. **VP-HOOK-030 namespace justification (VP-HOOK not VP-SKILL):**
STEP 1a SEVERITY-MISMATCH is a deterministic disposition-guard ENFORCEMENT surface (an ALLOW/DENY decision on
the verdict Write), a sibling of VP-HOOK-025 (enum-membership) and VP-HOOK-026 (hard-floor) — NOT folded into
VP-HOOK-029 (whose scope is the consumer-boundary fail-loud invariant), because STEP 1a is a distinct O6
trust-basis mechanism, not a fail-loud/under-label branch. **VP-SKILL-075 namespace justification (VP-SKILL not
VP-HOOK):** the operator-boundary signal is the exit code of the `run-monitoring-loop.sh` cron WRAPPER — a
helper script, NOT a PreToolUse hook — so it takes VP-SKILL (sibling to VP-SKILL-051 prism-version-check.sh),
matching the taxonomy where VP-HOOK is reserved for require-review.sh / disposition-guard.sh enforcement hooks.

**v1.14 (this edit — pass-11) re-verified occupancy independently before allocating any new VP/SM id

**VP-HOOK-031** (next free VP-HOOK after 030 — the separate human-comment investigation-markdown marker path, P11-004).

It is the O7 compliance artifact, exactly as VP-HOOK-024 is the O5 compliance artifact for `structural_label_check`.

inside BC-6.01.001 frontmatter, and SM-456 is the 'PRISM-456' charset EXAMPLE in BC-3.03.001 — neither a mutant);

**SM-P13-A → SM-52** (revert P13-001 — the markdown FP branch issues an autonomous `["comment"]` marker; killed by
the FP→allow-without-marker vector) and **SM-53** (NEW — disposition parse uses a full-document substring scan
instead of the canonical-heading-anchored parse; killed by the FP-in-code-fence vector, P13-003). **NO new VP id:**

(P13-001):** SM-50 (markdown kill-switch gate removal) and SM-51 (markdown non-FP→route-to-review-rule removal — the
former SM-P12-D) BOTH remain VALID; their killer vectors shift under P13-001 (SM-50 killed by the non-FP
`autonomy=false`→allow-without-marker vector; SM-51 killed by the TP→review vector — a removed routing rule now sends a
TP to allow-without-marker rather than a comment marker, since the comment path is gone). SM-52 is the NEW P13-001
FP-branch mutant and is DISTINCT from SM-51 (SM-51 = non-FP→review branch; SM-52 = FP→allow-without-marker branch).

returns VP-HOOK max **032** (range 024–032, unchanged this pass), and `grep -rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` returns max

No existing VP/SM renumbered; VP-HOOK-032 max unchanged; no re-scope. SM is now occupied 9–**54** (SM-32 =

`grep` confirmed VP-SKILL-076 and SM-54 both free before minting (the architect's §8.30.6 note left VP-SKILL-??? for FV
to verify — FV assigns the real next-free id).**

**Result: ZERO namespace collisions. No renumbering required (v1.9's two architect-proposed IDs were

VP-SKILL-050..076 and VP-HOOK-024..032 appears in exactly one *owning* BC.

**VP-HOOK-029 namespace justification (VP-HOOK vs VP-SKILL — pass 4; scope corrected pass-5/6; end-to-end re-scope + re-FINALIZED pass-7).**
The fail-loud invariant's ENFORCEMENT surface (the ALLOW/DENY decision and the marker store) is
hook-side, so the property stays in **VP-HOOK**; but per the **O4 standing rule (§0)** its *assertion*
is now the CONSUMER-BOUNDARY outcome, not an emitter-local artifact. For a hard-floor / Indeterminate /
silent-sensor verdict, VP-HOOK-029 asserts exactly one of two consumer-observable terminal states —
(i) **review path:** the verdict carries a `create-review`/`comment-review` token, STEP 3 issues the
restricted marker, AND a correctly-labeled `jr` write is authorized and consumable at consumer STEP 6a
(the human-surface jr write actually occurs); or (ii) **deny path:** the verdict carries a NON-review
token, STEP 4 **DENIES the verdict Write** with a structured corrective reason (`hard_floor_trigger`,
`required_token`, `label_instruction`, `instruction`) + an **UNDER-LABEL-DENIED** audit entry, NO
marker is issued, and on the loop's corrected re-document (with the required review token) path (i)
fires. It NEVER leaves an unconsumable marker in the store, and NEVER a silent allow-without-marker.
**Pass-7 redesign (ADV-F2-P7-001 CRITICAL / P7-004 MAJOR):** the pass-5/6 STEP-4 marker-*upgrade*
mechanism is RETIRED — P7-001 proved disposition-guard can rewrite the marker but not the loop's
future Bash command, so the upgraded `create-review` marker was structurally unconsumable by the
loop's own non-review `jr` command (3 of 4 under-label action types silently dropped the finding).
DENY-AT-WRITE is the only deterministic lever at the point the LLM can still react. STEP 4 still runs
**before the STEP 5 kill switch**, so the deny fires regardless of `autonomy_enabled` (the
kill-switch-irrelevance assertion). The old emitter-only VP-HOOK-029 assertion ("a marker exists OR an
error artifact was written") could NOT detect the unconsumable-marker seam gap (P7-004) — the re-scope
per architecture-delta §8.17 item 1 asserts the downstream jr authorization/execution instead.
BC-10.01.001 Inv#10 (narrowed so hard floors surface via a correctly-labeled review token, and STEP 4
deny-the-Writes under-labeled hard-floor verdicts) is the authoritative *definition*; BC-3.03.001
(STEP 4 deny + UNDER-LABEL-DENIED audit) + BC-3.01.001 v1.19 (consume create-review/comment-review at
step 6/6a) are the *enforcement* surfaces. VP-HOOK-029 lifecycle: re-marked **PROPOSED** pending the
deny-path vector set, then **re-FINALIZED (P0) v1.10**. **VP-SKILL-072
ownership.** First-run 24h lookback (BC-10.01.001 Inv#13 / EC-001) is a monitoring-loop
query-construction property — the loop, on an absent watermark file, MUST issue
`WHERE _time >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOURS` and MUST NOT scan full sensor history — so it belongs
in **VP-SKILL**. It is distinct from VP-SKILL-050 (watermark *monotonicity* + future-timestamp
rejection): VP-SKILL-050's incidental "first-run = 24h lookback" mention is subsumed and now
carries an explicit cross-reference to the dedicated VP-SKILL-072 (no double-allocation — 050
proves post ≥ pre on an *existing* watermark; 072 proves the *absent-watermark* lookback bound
and post-run persistence).

**VP-SKILL-069/070/071 ownership (pass 3).** VP-SKILL-069 owns to **BC-5.01.001** (investigate-event
Invariant #8 — Stage-3 OCSF lookup + temporal-adjacency PrismQL always carry an `org_slug` WHERE
clause) and VP-SKILL-070 owns to **BC-4.05.001** (assess-priority Invariant #4 — PC#5a/5b/5d PrismQL
paths always carry `org_slug`). These are the two PrismQL surfaces the adversary flagged (ADV-F2-P3-004)
as uncovered by VP-SKILL-064 (monitoring-loop-only) and VP-SKILL-059 (scan-threats-only); each BC
already lists its VP as PROPOSED with a matching BATS test-name pair, so finalization is a scope
confirmation, not a new assignment. VP-SKILL-071 owns to **BC-4.05.001** (PC#6 / D-DEC-011 — the
`confidence_score` float → `confidence` enum mapping fidelity at the 0.75/0.40 thresholds); it is
orthogonal to VP-SKILL-070 (query scoping) — no overlap. **VP-HOOK-028 namespace justification
(VP-HOOK vs VP-SKILL).** Like VP-HOOK-025/027, the verdict-path-reachability property's ALLOW/DENY
verdict is produced entirely hook-side: disposition-guard fast-path-allows a Write whose path lacks
the `verdict` substring (emitting NO marker), and require-review then DENIES the downstream Stage-8
`jr` Bash (no marker to consume). The monitoring-loop SKILL merely chooses the write path; the
enforcement surface is 100% hook-side, so the property belongs in **VP-HOOK**. BC-10.01.001 Stage-7
PC#8 (verdict-path naming convention) is the authoritative *definition*; BC-3.03.001 (fast-path) +
BC-3.01.001 (consume) are the *enforcement* surfaces.

**VP-HOOK-027 namespace justification (VP-HOOK vs VP-SKILL — pick and justify per task item 1).**
The stage-order document-before-action property is realized *entirely by the two PreToolUse
hooks*: disposition-guard (the emitter — must fire on the Stage 7 verdict Write and drop a
marker) and require-review (the consumer — DENIES the Stage 8 `jr` Bash call when no preceding
marker exists). The ALLOW/DENY verdict under test is produced by the hooks, not by any
skill-internal branch; the monitoring-loop SKILL merely orders the two tool calls. Because the
enforcement surface is 100% hook-side (identical to the VP-HOOK-024/025/026 marker family), the
property belongs in the **VP-HOOK** namespace, not VP-SKILL. This mirrors the VP-HOOK-025
define/enforce pattern: BC-10.01.001 Invariant #14 is the authoritative *definition* of the
ordering; BC-3.03.001 (emit) + BC-3.01.001 (consume) are the *enforcement* surfaces. It is
tagged **P1** per architecture-delta §8.7 item 1.

**VP-SKILL-066/067 own to BC-4.02.001** (update-jira, distinct from the monitoring-loop path
that VP-SKILL-062 covers): Invariant #4 (never-auto-reopen) and Invariant #5 (SLA surface) are
update-jira-skill invariants with no prior VP anchor (BC-4.02.001's VP table currently lists only
VP-SKILL-006/007/008 — see §7). **VP-SKILL-068 owns to BC-10.01.001** at the dedup/grace-window
invariant (Inv#8 / D-DEC-002) — orthogonal to VP-SKILL-050 (watermark monotonicity only), no
overlap. **VP-SKILL-064 and VP-SKILL-065 both
own to BC-10.01.001** (Invariant #1 and Invariant #11 respectively) — distinct invariants,
distinct properties, no overlap with the existing 050/060–063 monitoring-loop VPs. VP-HOOK-025
legitimately appears in two BCs because BC-10.01.001 Invariant #9 is the authoritative
field-list definition and BC-3.03.001 (disposition-guard) is the enforcement surface — this is
a define/enforce pair, not a double-allocation. The pre-F1 BCs (BC-3.02/3.04/3.05/3.06,
BC-4.01/4.03/4.04/4.06, BC-6.01.002, BC-7.01.001, BC-8.01.001) top out at VP-SKILL-049 /
VP-HOOK-023 with no overlap into the 050+/024+ ranges.

**Adjudication of the 12 proposed VPs (052–063): ALL FINALIZED.** They are well-formed, each
maps to a stated invariant in its owning BC, and each has a testable BATS strategy. No scope
overlap, no duplication of an existing VP's property. The `(PROPOSED)` qualifier has been
dropped by the product-owner in the BCs (first landed BC-10.01.001 v1.2 §Revision, BC-3.03.001
v1.8, BC-3.01.001 v1.13; current LIVE versions BC-10.01.001 v1.9, BC-3.03.001 v1.13, BC-3.01.001
v1.17); confirmed applied — see §7.

| VP ID | Name / Property | Strategy | Test surface | BC anchor |
|-------|-----------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| VP-HOOK-024 | Marker-validation soundness (schema v2.0, **iterative-consume**): write-block-matched command WITH a valid, unexpired (`now() > expires_at_utc` absolute check; 120s TTL), single-use, correctly-scoped, **ticket-bound** (`command_pattern` anchored to `<ticket_id> ` for comment/assign; operation-scoped for create), non-path-traversal marker → allow; candidates **sorted by `issued_at_utc` ASC (oldest first); the first candidate whose atomic `mv → .used` rename SUCCEEDS → allow; if every rename fails (all consumed by a concurrent invocation) → deny (fail-closed exhaustion)**; **rename-fail on a lone candidate → continue/deny (fail-closed)**; audit line appended with **base64-encoded** command to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/markers/audit.log`; replay of a consumed marker → deny. Covers comment/create/assign scoped allow-paths. Replaces the retired ">1-candidate → ambiguous deny" gate (architecture-delta §D-DEC-001 v1.3 / ADV-F2-P2-003). **v1.9 (ADV-F2-P6-001 CRITICAL): consumer STEP 6a anti-fungibility cross-check — review markers (`["create-review"]`) and regular markers (`["create"]`) are NOT fungible in either direction: a `["create-review"]` marker only authorizes a command carrying `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED\|BLIND-SPOT`, and a `["create"]` marker is refused for any command carrying a review label (EC-023). This is the hook-side (deterministic) enforcement of the review/regular distinction that D-DEC-012's Alternatives-Rejected reversal now ADOPTS — it is a security control that cannot live only in the untrusted SKILL.md Iron Law.** **v1.5 (ADV-F2-P4-002 CRITICAL): create `command_pattern` injection-safety — the create pattern is anchored `^jr (--output json )?issue create --project <key>( \|$)` with `--project` as the FIRST flag (no `.*` before it) and a trailing `( \|$)` boundary; an attacker-influenceable `--summary` value carrying a `--project ORG_A` substring does NOT match an ORG_A-scoped create marker; a `--project PROD` marker does NOT authorize `--project PRODUCTION` (prefix guard). v1.5 (ADV-F2-P4-010): audit line strips control chars (`tr -d '\000-\037'`) from `ticket_id`/`org_slug`/`op` before interpolation — a `\n` in `ticket_id` cannot forge a second MARKER_USED line.** | B-BEH + B-INT-XH | require-review.sh stdin envelope `{tool_input.command}`; `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA=$(mktemp -d)`; assert `.used` rename + `markers/audit.log` `command_b64=` line; ticket-bound vector (SEC-123 marker → DENY SEC-456); create/assign scoped allow vectors; **concurrent same-scope: two valid markers → oldest consumed, ALLOW; all-renames-fail → exhausted DENY**; **v1.5 injection vectors: marker `command_pattern="^jr (--output json )?issue create --project ORG_A( \|$)"` + command `jr issue create --summary "review --project ORG_A" --project ORG_B` → DENY; `--project PROD` marker + `--project PRODUCTION` command → DENY; v1.5 audit: `ticket_id` containing `$'\n'` → single MARKER_USED line only (control chars stripped).** **v1.9 consumer STEP 6a anti-fungibility (ADV-F2-P6-001 CRITICAL, EC-023): a `["create-review"]` marker + `jr issue create --project ORG_A` WITHOUT `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED\|BLIND-SPOT` → NOT consumed, DENY (named vector `create-review-marker-requires-review-label`, kills SM-36); a `["create"]` marker + `jr issue create --project ORG_A --label REVIEW-REQUIRED …` (carries a review label) → NOT consumed, DENY (named vector `create-marker-rejects-review-label`, kills SM-37); correct pairings — `["create-review"]` marker + `--label BLIND-SPOT` command → consumed ALLOW, and `["create"]` marker + no-label command → consumed ALLOW. `has_review_label` is a structural property of the command, not Jira content; comment/comment-review structural `--label` check pends ASM-014 (current comment-review guard = ticket_id binding + Iron Law).** **v1.10/v1.11 STEP 6a structural-check false-deny prevention (ADV-F2-P7-005 MINOR → ADV-F2-P8-002 MAJOR, D-DEC-001 `structural_label_check`): `has_review_label` is a STRUCTURAL token check (`--label` must appear as a standalone token immediately preceding `REVIEW-REQUIRED`/`BLIND-SPOT`), NOT a raw substring over the whole command. **v1.11 (P8-002): the P7-005 `split_on_whitespace` was insufficient — the hook receives `tool_input.command` as the RAW command string with literal quotes (`jq -r`, no shell expansion), and a naive whitespace split of a quoted `--summary` value STILL yields a standalone `--label` token immediately before `REVIEW-REQUIRED` (EC-024's own example false-denies). The check is now a QUOTE-AWARE state-machine tokenizer (UNQUOTED/IN_SINGLE/IN_DOUBLE) that keeps a quoted region as one token.** Named vector `regular-create-with-label-literal-in-summary-allowed` (updated to the QUOTED form explicitly): a `["create"]` marker + `jr issue create --project PRISMDEMO --summary "rule matched literal --label REVIEW-REQUIRED in alert payload"` (the `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` literal lives INSIDE a double-quoted `--summary` value; the tokenizer enters IN_DOUBLE at the opening `"` so the whole value is one token → NO standalone `--label` token) → `has_review_label=false` → **ALLOW** (consumed; not a false-deny). Paired mutants: **SM-40** (revert `has_review_label` to the raw-substring check) → the quoted vector DENYs (substring matches inside the quoted region) and the mutant dies; **SM-42** (v1.11 — revert `structural_label_check` to non-quote-aware `split_on_whitespace`) → the quoted vector DENYs (whitespace-splitting breaks the quoted value into a standalone `--label` token) and the mutant dies. **The single quoted-form vector SEPARATELY kills SM-40 and SM-42** — each mutation, applied alone, drives the vector to DENY for a distinct reason (SM-40: raw-substring content match; SM-42: naive token split of the quoted value), so both are independently detected. **P8-003 note: this vector's fail-closed security rests on the anchored step-5 `command_pattern` (a `["create"]` marker only authorizes a genuine `jr issue create`); step-6a `has_review_label` is the SOLE enforcement point for the create/create-review ANTI-FUNGIBILITY distinction (EC-023 direction A) — bash `[[ =~ ]]` is NOT tail-anchored, so step 5 does NOT reject a review-labeled create as a backstop.** **v1.12 STEP 6a ESCAPED-QUOTE differential-vs-bash partition (ADV-F2-P9-001 MAJOR, O5 / D-DEC-001 v1.12): the P8-002 tokenizer toggled UNQUOTED/IN_SINGLE/IN_DOUBLE on EVERY `"`/`'` regardless of a preceding backslash — diverging from bash, which honors `\"`/`\'` as literal escaped characters. With the P8-003 step-5 backstop gone, step-6a is the SOLE anti-fungibility gate, so this divergence is exploitable. The D-DEC-001 v1.12 fix makes the tokenizer backslash-aware (`\"` in IN_DOUBLE → literal `"`, STAY IN_DOUBLE; `\'` in UNQUOTED → literal `'`, NO IN_SINGLE toggle), matching bash. Vectors — (1a SECURITY, kills SM-43) `["create"]` marker + `jr issue create --project PRISMDEMO --summary "a\"b" --label REVIEW-REQUIRED`: bash/jr parse the args as `[--summary, a"b, --label, REVIEW-REQUIRED]` and apply a FUNCTIONAL REVIEW-REQUIRED label; the backslash-aware tokenizer keeps `\"` inside IN_DOUBLE so the double-quoted `--summary` closes only at the FINAL `"`, leaving `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` as standalone tokens → `has_review_label=TRUE` → **DENY** (the regular marker cannot authorize a review-labeled create — bypass prevented); (1b FALSE-DENY PREVENTION) `["create"]` marker + `jr issue create --project PRISMDEMO --summary "a\"b"` (escaped quote inside the summary, NO real trailing `--label`) → the whole `--summary` value is one IN_DOUBLE token, no standalone `--label` → `has_review_label=FALSE` → **ALLOW**; (partition-2 UNQUOTED completeness) `jr issue create --project PRISMDEMO --summary O\'Brien --label REVIEW-REQUIRED` → `\'` is a literal apostrophe with NO IN_SINGLE state entered, so the trailing whitespace-preceded `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` is a standalone token → `has_review_label=TRUE` → **DENY** (proves no accidental IN_SINGLE swallow). Paired mutant **SM-43** (revert the D-DEC-001 v1.12 IN_DOUBLE backslash handling to the P8-002 toggle-on-every-quote → `\"` closes the quoted region, `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` is swallowed into the summary token, `has_review_label=FALSE`, the `["create"]` marker wrongly ALLOWs) killed by vector 1a; **SEPARATELY killable from SM-42** (split_on_whitespace revert) **and SM-40** (raw-substring revert) — SM-43 tests the backslash-escape class the other two do not exercise. **Equals-form `--label=REVIEW-REQUIRED` SCOPED OUT — jr CLI does not support the equals form (`jr issue create --help`, confirmed 2026-07-21); only `--label VALUE` space-separated form is emitted.

## 3. Answers to the Product-Owner's 4 Open Technical Questions (encoded as VP design decisions)

**(a) VP-HOOK-025 mechanism — disposition-guard dual-path [UPDATED v1.3 — artifact-class field-set
branching, D-DEC-008-C].** The hook branches on artifact class, and **the required field-set differs
per class** (the pass-3 correction — ADV-F2-P3-003; BC-3.03.001 v1.13 PC#2 corrected from the 15-field
erratum to 12; BC-5.01.001 v1.8 Inv#7's 12-field citation was already correct): (i) if
`tool_input.file_path` matches the investigation-markdown pattern (`*investigation-*.md`) →
heading-anchored check (`grep -qiE "^#{1,6}[[:space:]]+<field>"`) for the **12 ICD-203 field headings
ONLY** (Disposition, Confidence, Sensor Health Status, Evidence Artifacts, Timeline Events,
Hypotheses Considered, Alternatives Rejected, Uncertainty Explicit, Attack Techniques, Agent Actions,
Human Actions, Tuning Signal). Severity / Asset Type / Ticket Action Type are **NOT required** for the
investigation-markdown class (Ticket Action Type is meaningless for a human investigation), and their
presence in an investigation file must **NOT** trigger a wrong-class 18-field deny (SM-30 is the paired
over-strict mutant). (ii) if the file is a verdict file (verdict path/extension OR `tool_input.content`
parses as JSON via `jq empty`) → JSON key-presence + type check for **ALL 18 fields**. Key-presence
uses `jq -e 'has("<field>")'` (NOT `!= null`, so a present-null key is distinguishable from an absent
one — fail-closed deny if any of the 18 `has()` returns false).
**ADV-F2-001/004 fix: fields 13–15 added — `severity` (field 13), `asset_type` (field 14),
`ticket_action_type` (field 15).** **ADV-F2-P10-001 (v1.13): fields 16–17 added — `native_severity`
(field 16, the raw sensor-native severity value carried verbatim from Stage-1 INGEST) and `sensor_family`
(field 17, enum ∈{crowdstrike,armis,claroty,cyberint}) — REQUIRED so disposition-guard STEP 1a can
re-run `NORMALIZE_SEVERITY(native_severity, sensor_family)` and cross-check `verdict.severity` for CONSISTENCY (the O6
SEVERITY-MISMATCH deny, owned by VP-HOOK-030 — a consistency check between two LLM-supplied fields, NOT ground-truth
enforcement, P11-001; see the STEP 1a note below).** **ADV-F2-P11-002 (v1.14): field 18 added — `scored_priority`
(field 18, enum ∈{CRIT,HIGH,MED,LOW}, the Stage-5 assess-priority output carried into the verdict) — REQUIRED because
`hard_floor_applies()` keys the HIGH/CRIT hard floor on `verdict.scored_priority`, NOT on recomputed severity (brief
§3.9 "any alert scored HIGH/CRIT → human"; captures KEV/exposure escalations of a detector-LOW alert). scored_priority
is LLM-supplied — same ASM-008-class residual, NOT asserted as ground-truth.** Per-field type assertions (the original 12):
`disposition` string∈{TP,FP,BTP,Indeterminate}; **`confidence` is ENUM-ONLY (D-DEC-011): `type=="string" and (.=="high" or .=="medium" or .=="low")` — a float value (e.g. `0.85`) FAILS this assertion and is DENIED (ADV-F2-P3-008); the producer-side float→enum mapping is guaranteed by VP-SKILL-071 on the assess-priority side, disposition-guard is the enforcement backstop);**
`sensor_health_status` string∈{healthy,degraded,silent}; `evidence_artifacts`/`timeline_events`/`hypotheses_considered`/`alternatives_rejected`/`attack_techniques`/`agent_actions`/`human_actions`
each `type=="array"`; `uncertainty_explicit` `type=="string" or .==null`; `tuning_signal`
`type=="object" or .==null` (with disposition-conditional rule per (d)). **New (fields 13–15):**
`severity` string∈{LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL} (the LLM-reported detector-native severity — **v1.13/P10-001 +
v1.14/P11-001/P11-002: NO LONGER the input to the hard-floor check; STEP 1a cross-checks it against
`NORMALIZE_SEVERITY(native_severity, sensor_family)` for CONSISTENCY only (both fields LLM-supplied — a consistency
check, NOT ground-truth, P11-001); the HIGH/CRIT `hard_floor_applies()` floor keys on `verdict.scored_priority`
(field 18, P11-002), NOT on recomputed severity — verdict.severity and scored_priority may legitimately differ** — NOT
`confidence`, which is an orthogonal axis; ADV-F2-001); `asset_type` string∈{domain_controller,privileged_account,ot_safety_system,standard,unknown}
(critical-asset hard-floor input; prism_asset_class cross-validation ASM-008-DEFERRED); `ticket_action_type` string∈{comment,create,assign,none}
(selects the emitter scope branch per D-DEC-008; **v1.5: enum extended to
{comment,create,assign,none,create-review,comment-review}** — `create-review`/`comment-review`
are the D-DEC-012 review-surfacing tokens; `none` ⇒ no marker written). **New (fields 16–17, v1.13/P10-001):**
`native_severity` `type=="string" and .!=""` (raw sensor-native severity carried from Stage-1 INGEST —
absent/empty → fail-closed deny); `sensor_family` string∈{crowdstrike,armis,claroty,cyberint} (non-member
→ fail-closed deny — an enum deny, NOT a SEVERITY-MISMATCH). **New (field 18, v1.14/P11-002):**
`scored_priority` string∈{CRIT,HIGH,MED,LOW} (Stage-5 assess-priority output; the HIGH/CRIT hard-floor key per
`hard_floor_applies()`; absent/non-member → fail-closed deny; LLM-supplied — same ASM-008-class residual, NOT
ground-truth). Malformed JSON →
fail-closed deny (mirrors BC-3.01.001 EC-020 marker handling). This is implementable in bash
with `jq` only — no new dependency. Enforced per BC-3.03.001 (post-pass-11) PC#1/2/3 (dual-path) and
BC-10.01.001 v1.14 Invariant #9 (**18-field list** + `autonomy_enabled` operational field).

**[NEW v1.13 — STEP 1a severity re-normalization, SEVERITY-MISMATCH; DOWNGRADED v1.14 to a CONSISTENCY CHECK
(ADV-F2-P10-001 CRITICAL / ADV-F2-P11-001 CRITICAL / O6 standing rule §0; owned by VP-HOOK-030).]** After
`validate_enums()` (STEP 1) confirms fields 16/17 are present and well-typed, disposition-guard STEP 1a re-runs
`recomputed_severity = NORMALIZE_SEVERITY(verdict.native_severity, verdict.sensor_family)` using the SAME D-DEC-013
deterministic table the monitoring loop used at Stage-1 INGEST (a pure lookup; no prism data dependency). **IF
`recomputed_severity != verdict.severity` → WRITE a `SEVERITY-MISMATCH` audit entry naming both values +
emit `deny` (the verdict Write is refused BEFORE any marker decision).** **P11-001 CORRECTION (v1.14):** the pass-10
framing that this "relocates severity trust from the LLM to the hook" and makes the floor "genuinely un-bypassable /
independently derived from raw sensor values" was **FALSE and is WITHDRAWN**. `native_severity` (field 16) and
`sensor_family` (field 17) are BOTH written by the monitoring-loop LLM at Stage-1 INGEST and read verbatim; the
network-free hook makes **no prism call**, so STEP 1a is a deterministic CONSISTENCY CHECK between two LLM-supplied
fields — it hardens against a careless/buggy LLM but CANNOT detect an adversarial LLM that supplies a false
`native_severity`+`sensor_family` pair (writing `native_severity="10"`/`sensor_family=crowdstrike`/`severity="LOW"`
for a genuinely CRITICAL alert passes the consistency check). **The asserted guarantee is exactly: "verdict.severity
is CONSISTENT with verdict.native_severity per the D-DEC-013 table."** Genuine severity ground-truth is
**ASM-008-DEFERRED, SYMMETRIC with the asset_type residual** (a prism-signed severity field or hook-fetched prism data;
network-free hooks cannot provide it). **STEP 1a does NOT gate recalibration and does NOT feed the high-severity floor:**
`hard_floor_applies()` keys the HIGH/CRIT floor on `verdict.scored_priority` (field 18 — P11-002), NOT on
recomputed severity; `verdict.severity` (detector-native) and `verdict.scored_priority` (Stage-5 recalibrated) may
legitimately differ. Paired mutant **SM-44** (revert STEP 1a → drop the consistency cross-check) is killed by
VP-HOOK-030's per-family SEVERITY-MISMATCH vectors. This is NOT a second normalization — it is a CONSISTENCY
CROSS-CHECK: the LLM-reported severity must agree with what the deterministic table produces for the same
(LLM-supplied) inputs.

**[UPDATED v1.5 — JSON-first dispatch precedence (ADV-F2-P4-001 CRITICAL).]** The class-dispatch
order is now **JSON-first, and this precedence is load-bearing**: the canonical verdict path
`artifacts/investigations/verdict-<id>-<iso_ts>.json` contains BOTH the `investigation` (directory)
and `verdict` (filename) substrings, so a plain "check `investigation` substring first" router would
misroute the canonical verdict JSON to the 12-field heading-grep branch, fail every `## `-heading
assertion, DENY the write, emit no marker, and render the entire autonomous pipeline unreachable.
The corrected dispatch is exactly the order this doc already specified in (a)(ii): **(1)** if
`tool_input.content` parses as JSON via `jq empty` OR `file_path` ends in `.json` → **verdict-class
18-field + `validate_enums()` + STEP 1a SEVERITY-MISMATCH consistency path** (REGARDLESS of any `investigation` substring in the path);
**(2)** elif `file_path` matches `*investigation-*.md` → investigation-class 12-field markdown path;
**(3)** else → fast-path allow (no ICD-203 validation). BC-3.03.001 v1.13 PC#1/2/3 are rewritten to
this order (PC#1 = JSON check; PC#2 = investigation `.md`; PC#3 = fast-path). Mutant **SM-34**
(dispatch-order-inverted — check the `investigation` substring before the JSON test) is the paired
kill target; VP-HOOK-028's canonical-path leg asserts `.../verdict-alert-001.json` → 18-field path
→ marker (positive) and `.../investigation-001.md` → 12-field path.

**[UPDATED v1.5 — `validate_enums()` membership gate (ADV-F2-P4-006 MAJOR).]** BC-3.03.001 v1.11
PC#3 described the verdict-JSON check as key-presence only (`jq has()`), but `hard_floor_applies()`
keys on exact-string membership. A case-mangled `severity:"High"` therefore passed key-presence yet
silently failed the `"High" ∈ {"HIGH","CRITICAL"}` test → NO hard floor → a marker was issued for
an actually-HIGH-severity alert. v1.5 adds an explicit `validate_enums(verdict)` step (D-DEC-008
emitter pseudocode) that runs **BEFORE** the hard-floor check and **fail-closed DENIES** any
non-member value on ALL typed fields: `severity ∈ {LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL}`,
`asset_type ∈ {domain_controller,privileged_account,ot_safety_system,standard,unknown}`,
`disposition ∈ {TP,FP,BTP,Indeterminate}`, `sensor_health_status ∈ {healthy,degraded,silent}`,
`ticket_action_type ∈ {comment,create,assign,none,create-review,comment-review}`,
`confidence ∈ {high,medium,low}`. Fail-closed DENY (not allow-without-marker) is the correct
posture — allowing a field-mangled verdict to write to the investigation store without an ICD-203
guarantee is the failure mode P4-006 flagged. Mutant **SM-31** (validate_enums-removed → wrong-case
`severity` passes the hard floor and wrongly gets a marker) is the paired kill target.

**(b) ASM-009 cross-hook marker visibility + atomic consume-on-use — BATS integration test.**
Add to `integration.bats` a `setup()` that does `export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA="$(mktemp -d)"`
(teardown `rm -rf`). Test sequence (three SEPARATE subprocess hook invocations, same exported
env = exactly the ASM-009 condition — DG writes, RR reads, distinct processes):
(1) invoke `disposition-guard.sh` with a verdict passing all **17** fields + non-hard-floor
disposition (FP / confidence=high / severity=LOW / asset_type=standard / healthy sensor /
ticket_action_type=comment / **native_severity="10" / sensor_family=crowdstrike** — so STEP 1a
recomputes LOW and agrees, no SEVERITY-MISMATCH) → assert a `<uuid>.marker.json` (schema v2.0: `issued_at_utc`,
`expires_at_utc` = +120s, ticket-bound `command_pattern`) now exists in
`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/markers/`;
(2) invoke `require-review.sh` with `jr issue comment SEC-123 "..."` → assert `allow` AND the
marker file is now renamed to `*.marker.json.used` (cross-hook visibility + consume-on-use) AND
an `audit.log` line with a `command_b64=` (base64) field is appended;
(3) invoke `require-review.sh` a SECOND time with the same command → assert `deny`
(fail-closed on the consumed marker — proves single-use atomicity via POSIX rename; and note the
v2.0 rename-fail→deny leg is a distinct fixture). This is VP-HOOK-024's replay leg realized as an
integration test and is the empirical validator ASM-009 demands before Wave 3 merge.

**[UPDATED v1.2 — iterative-consume + document-before-action (ADV-F2-P2-001/P2-003).]** The
consumer is now **iterative-consume**, not ">1 → ambiguous deny" (architecture-delta §D-DEC-001
v1.3): candidates are sorted `issued_at_utc` ASC and the loop consumes the oldest whose atomic
`mv → .used` rename succeeds; if all renames fail it denies (fail-closed exhaustion). Two added
integration legs: (i) **concurrent same-scope** — write TWO valid same-scope markers via two
disposition-guard invocations, then one require-review call → assert `allow` with the *oldest*
marker consumed and the newer one still present (legitimate multi-alert loop run no longer
mutually invalidates — the ADV-F2-P2-003 fix); (ii) **exhaustion** — pre-rename both candidates
to `.used` out-of-band, then require-review → assert `deny`. Separately, **VP-HOOK-027**
(document-before-action) uses this same harness but flips the *ordering*: the negative leg invokes
require-review on the `jr` Bash call with an EMPTY marker dir (Stage 8 before Stage 7) → assert
`deny`; the positive leg runs disposition-guard-Write (Stage 7) → require-review-Bash (Stage 8) →
assert `allow`. VP-HOOK-027 is the process-gap guard the adversary flagged (P2-014) that would
have caught the P2-001 inverted-stage CRITICAL.

**(c) VP-HOOK-026 fixture mechanism — env-var + stdin-envelope injection (config-file injection
REJECTED).** Established pattern in `tests/hooks.bats`: every hook is driven purely by the
stdin JSON envelope (`{tool_input.command}` / `{tool_input.file_path, content}`) with
`PLUGIN_ROOT` from `BATS_TEST_DIRNAME`; there is NO existing config-file read pattern in any
hook, and BC-3.01.001 Invariant #2 constrains the hook to decide "from the stdin JSON envelope
only" (plus, for require-review, the marker store). Filesystem roots are supplied via env-var
(`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, matching the architecture-delta §Testing-Architecture `mktemp -d` +
`export` mandate). Therefore VP-HOOK-026 injects: `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA=$(mktemp -d)` for the
marker-store, and the hard-floor verdict + `autonomy_enabled: true` inside `tool_input.content`.
Because disposition-guard's hard floor is an UNCONDITIONAL branch that never consults autonomy
state, the proof is: feed `autonomy_enabled=true` alongside each hard-floor category in turn and
assert `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/markers/` remains empty after the hook returns.
**ADV-F2-001 leg correction (v1.1):** the earlier draft's legs injected non-existent fields; the
hard-floor keys on the LIVE 18-field schema (**v1.13/P10-001 + v1.14/P11-002: the HIGH/CRIT floor keys on
`verdict.scored_priority` (field 18), NOT on `verdict.severity` or recomputed severity; STEP 1a only
consistency-checks severity↔native_severity**), so the corrected legs inject:
(1) `disposition=Indeterminate`; (2) **`verdict.scored_priority=HIGH`** (field 18 — the HIGH/CRIT floor key
per P11-002, NOT `confidence`; scored_priority and confidence are orthogonal axes, so this leg pairs
`scored_priority=HIGH` with `confidence=low` to prove the hard floor still fires; the v1.14 scored_priority
partition on the VP-HOOK-026 test surface adds the detector-LOW/scored-CRIT escalation leg + SM-46);
(3) **`verdict.asset_type=critical-asset`**
(field 14, e.g. `domain_controller`); (4) `attack_techniques` contains `T1003`;
(5) `sensor_health_status=degraded`; **(6) NEW v1.3 (ADV-F2-P3-001 CRITICAL) — `verdict.asset_type=unknown`
paired with `severity=LOW` + a benign (non-hard-floor) technique + `ticket_action_type=comment`:
the `unknown` asset_type is a conservative hard-floor member (BC-3.03.001 v1.13 Inv#4 / BC-10.01.001
v1.9 Inv#10), so even a fully-benign verdict with an unclassified asset must NOT receive a marker.**
Each leg asserts **NO marker is issued** (marker dir empty) regardless of `autonomy_enabled=true`.
The unknown-asset leg is the defense-in-depth guarantee the adversary flagged as false: the hook must
block the marker independently of SKILL.md behavior. Mutant SM-29 (unknown-asset-hard-floor-removed) is
the paired kill target. Config-file injection is rejected — it would introduce an input surface no hook
reads and diverge from the harness.

**[UPDATED v1.5 — `autonomy_enabled` is a verdict field read directly by the hook + review-surfacing
exemptions (ADV-F2-P4-004/P4-005, D-DEC-012).]** Two v1.5 corrections change the VP-HOOK-026 leg set,
both keeping the env-var + stdin-envelope harness (config-file injection still REJECTED): **(A)
kill-switch determinism (P4-005):** `autonomy_enabled` is now a NON-ICD-203 operational metadata field
IN the verdict JSON (alongside `jira_project_key`/`confidence_score`), and disposition-guard reads it
DIRECTLY (D-DEC-008 emitter Step 5 — the kill switch, renumbered from Step 4 by the ADV-F2-P6-002
reorder) rather than trusting the loop LLM to have set
`ticket_action_type=none`. `autonomy_enabled != true` (false OR **absent → conservative false**)
suppresses ALL REGULAR markers. New legs: `autonomy_enabled=false` + regular `create` → NO marker;
`+ comment` → NO marker; `autonomy_enabled` ABSENT + regular `create` → treated false → NO marker.
Mutant **SM-33** (autonomy_enabled-clause-removed → a regular marker is wrongly emitted under the kill
switch) is the paired kill target. **(B) review-surfacing exemptions (P4-004, D-DEC-012):** the
`create-review`/`comment-review` ticket_action_types are EXEMPT from BOTH the hard-floor no-marker rule
AND the kill switch (emitter Step 3 correct-label review path runs before the
Step 5 kill switch; an under-labeled hard-floor verdict is DENIED at Step 4 — before Step 5 too — so the
loop re-documents with a review token, per the v1.10 deny-the-Write redesign), because creating a `[REVIEW-REQUIRED]` /
`[BLIND-SPOT]` ticket is human ESCALATION, not autonomous triage. Legs: Indeterminate +
`create-review` → restricted marker emitted (`authorized_operations=["create-review"]`, hard-floor
EXEMPT); silent-sensor + `comment-review` → restricted marker emitted; HIGH-severity + `create-review`
→ marker emitted; `autonomy_enabled=false` + `create-review` → marker STILL emitted (kill-switch
EXEMPT). The legs assert a marker IS emitted, so the "remove the review exemption entirely →
over-strict, review ticket dropped" direction is killed here.

**[UPDATED v1.8 / v1.9 / v1.10 — the STEP 3 review-exemption is GATED on `hard_floor_applies()`; the review token is
no longer trusted unconditionally (ADV-F2-P5-002 MAJOR); the STEP 4 handling of an under-labeled hard-floor
verdict is the fail-loud dual (ADV-F2-P5-001 CRITICAL), which — post the ADV-F2-P7-001 redesign — is now a
DENY-THE-WRITE (marker-upgrade RETIRED) and still runs BEFORE the STEP 5 kill switch.]** Pass-4 treated the `create-review`/`comment-review`
exemption as UNCONDITIONAL on the LLM-supplied `ticket_action_type`, which let the LLM manufacture a
kill-switch + hard-floor bypass by over-labeling a regular verdict as a review action (P5-002).
The architect's D-DEC-008 STEP 3 fix (architecture-delta v1.8) gates the exemption on the
hook-computed `hard_floor_applies(verdict)`: `IF NOT hard_floor_applies(): emit allow WITHOUT marker;
RETURN`. **New v1.8 OVER-LABEL legs (VP-HOOK-026):** non-hard-floor TP verdict (LOW severity, standard
asset) + `create-review` → NO marker; non-hard-floor FP + `comment-review` + `autonomy_enabled=false`
→ NO marker (no kill-switch bypass); LOW-severity standard asset + `create-review` → NO marker. The
paired kill target for the over-label legs is **SM-32b** (remove the STEP 3 `NOT hard_floor_applies()`
gate → a non-hard-floor verdict with a review token gets the exempt marker; the over-label legs assert
NO marker, so the mutant dies). The **under-label** dual (a hard-floor verdict carrying a NON-review
token) is enforced at STEP 4's DENY-THE-WRITE and proved end-to-end by **VP-HOOK-029** (the consumer-boundary
re-scope, §2); its paired mutants are **SM-38** (remove the STEP-4 deny → silent allow), **SM-39** (remove the
corrective-reason structure), and the re-targeted **SM-32a** (revert the deny to the retired upgrade →
unconsumable in-store marker), with **SM-32-ext** (revert the STEP 4/5 order) killed by VP-HOOK-029's
kill-switch-irrelevance deny vector. The unconditional-hard-floor legs (1)–(6) above are UNCHANGED for
REGULAR (comment/create/assign) markers; the review-surfacing legs (hard_floor_applies()=TRUE → marker
emitted) are UNCHANGED and remain valid under the gated STEP 3.
**[UPDATED v1.11 — STEP 3 correctly-labeled-yet-unbindable deny (ADV-F2-P8-001 CRITICAL).]** The review-surfacing
legs assume the operational binding field is present. The adversary (P8-001) showed the *correctly-labeled*
review path had its own silent-discard sub-case: a genuinely hard-floor verdict with a CORRECT review token
but a null non-ICD-203 binding field (`create-review` + null/empty `jira_project_key`; `comment-review` +
null `ticket_id`) hit a silent `emit allow without marker; RETURN` at STEP 3 — and since `jira_project_key`/
`ticket_id` are in neither the 18-field presence check nor `validate_enums()`, the verdict passed every prior
gate and the hard-floor finding was silently dropped. The redesigned D-DEC-008 STEP 3 (architecture-delta
v1.11) replaces both silent-allow branches with a **`HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` DENY-THE-WRITE** per D-DEC-012
clause 2 (audit entry naming `missing_field`; structured deny reason with `hard_floor_trigger` + re-issue
instruction; the comment-review branch adds a create-review fallback hint when `jira_project_key` is present).
So the gated STEP 3 exemption now produces exactly one of {a bindable review marker, a `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE`
deny} — NEVER a silent allow. This is the fail-loud invariant owned end-to-end by **VP-HOOK-029** (unbindable-deny
vectors 9–11, §2); paired mutant **SM-41** (revert the STEP-3 create-review null-`jira_project_key` branch to
emit-allow-without-marker). Bounded non-termination mirrors STEP 4 — one audit entry + one deny per re-doc
attempt, no Jira write, no silent loop.

**(d) tuning_signal null-vs-absent — jq check.** Three-way distinction, evaluated in order:
`has("tuning_signal") == false` → **INVALID ALWAYS** (absent key is a schema violation → deny);
`.tuning_signal == null` (key present, null) → **REQUIRED/valid for disposition∈{TP,Indeterminate}**,
INVALID for {FP,BTP}; non-null → must be an object with `rule_id`,`asset`,`reason`, **REQUIRED
for {FP,BTP}** (and acceptable for TP/Indeterminate). Encoding:
`jq -e 'has("tuning_signal")'` (else deny); then
`disp=$(jq -r .disposition)`; if `FP|BTP`:
`jq -e '.tuning_signal!=null and (.tuning_signal|type=="object") and (.tuning_signal|has("rule_id") and has("asset") and has("reason"))'` (else deny);
if `TP|Indeterminate`: `jq -e '.tuning_signal==null or (.tuning_signal|type=="object")'`
(else deny). Note the deliberate use of `has()` for presence and `== null` for the value —
conflating the two is mutant SM-18 (§4).

## 4. SM-N Mutant Catalog Extension

Existing catalog runs SM-1..SM-8b (verification-gap-analysis.md §Surviving Mutants). New
high-value mutants for the marker-validation path (require-review, **CRITICAL — target ≥95%**)
and the disposition-guard JSON path + monitoring-loop (**HIGH — target ≥90%**; the
monitoring-loop-verdict enforcement it guards is on the CRITICAL Jira-write path). **v1.1 added
SM-20..SM-25 for the 15-field schema, the ticket-scoped emitter, the ADV-F2-001 severity/confidence
fix, the ADV-F2-005 hard-floor-ordering fix, and the two new VPs (org_slug, kill switch). v1.2
retargets SM-15 to the iterative-consume path (the ">1 ambiguous deny" mutation target was retired
at architecture-delta §D-DEC-001 v1.3) and adds SM-26 (reopen-guard-removed), SM-27
(dedup-check-removed→double-ticket), SM-28 (stage-order-inverted). v1.3 adds SM-29
(unknown-asset-hard-floor-removed, ADV-F2-P3-001) and SM-30 (artifact-class-over-strict,
ADV-F2-P3-003). **v1.5 adds SM-31 (validate_enums-removed, ADV-F2-P4-006), SM-32
(review-surfacing-hard-floor-bypass-removed, D-DEC-012/ADV-F2-P4-004), SM-33
(autonomy_enabled-clause-removed, ADV-F2-P4-005), SM-34 (dispatch-order-inverted, ADV-F2-P4-001),
and SM-35 (control-char-strip-removed, ADV-F2-P4-010).** **v1.8 RE-SCOPES SM-32 into two
separately-killable variants — SM-32a (step4-under-label-upgrade-removed, ADV-F2-P5-001 CRITICAL,
killed by VP-HOOK-029) and SM-32b (step3-hard-floor-gate-removed, ADV-F2-P5-002 MAJOR, killed by
VP-HOOK-026) — raising the count 27 → 28 (SM-9..SM-35, with SM-32 = SM-32a + SM-32b).** **v1.9
(pass-6) adds THREE mutants: SM-32-ext (step-order-reverted → STEP 5 kill switch back before the
STEP 4 under-label upgrade, ADV-F2-P6-002 CRITICAL, killed by VP-HOOK-029's kill-switch-on under-label
vectors), SM-36 (consumer-review-label-check-removed, ADV-F2-P6-001 CRITICAL, killed by VP-HOOK-024)
and SM-37 (consumer-reverse-label-check-removed, ADV-F2-P6-001 CRITICAL, killed by VP-HOOK-024) —
raising the count 28 → 31 (SM-9..SM-37, with SM-32 = SM-32a + SM-32b + SM-32-ext; SM-33/34/35 are the
PRE-EXISTING pass-4 mutants — NAMESPACE NOTE: architect §8.15 item 5 mis-named the consumer mutants
"SM-33/SM-34", which collide with occupied ids; they are allocated the next free SM-36/SM-37).** **v1.10
(pass-7) adds THREE mutants for the STEP-4 DENY-THE-WRITE redesign (occupancy re-verified — `grep -rhoE

deny-path vectors), SM-39 (deny-corrective-reason-removed → the deny fires but the loop cannot act on a
structureless message, ADV-F2-P7-004 MAJOR, killed by VP-HOOK-029's machine-actionable-reason vector),
and SM-40 (has_review_label-reverted-to-raw-substring → false-deny of a regular create whose --summary
contains the label literal, ADV-F2-P7-005 MINOR, killed by VP-HOOK-024's step-6a false-deny vector) —
raising the count 31 → 34 (SM-9..SM-40, with SM-32 = SM-32a + SM-32b + SM-32-ext). SM-32a is RE-TARGETED
(the STEP-4 upgrade it formerly removed is RETIRED) to "revert the STEP-4 deny to the retired
GOTO-WRITE_MARKER upgrade" (killed by VP-HOOK-029's consumer-boundary vector — the marker is present but
unconsumable); SM-32-ext's kill vector is RE-WORDED to the deny-before-kill-switch assertion. Neither
re-target/re-word adds or removes an id.** **v1.11 (pass-8) adds TWO mutants (occupancy re-verified — `grep
-rhoE 'SM-[0-9]+' .factory/` max real = SM-40, SM-2026 a date false-positive; next free = SM-41): SM-41

no-validate_enums-on-markdown / compliant-save vectors) — raising the count 39 → 41 (SM-9..SM-47, with SM-32 =
SM-32a + SM-32b + SM-32-ext). No re-target/renumber this pass.** **v1.15 (pass-12) adds FOUR mutants (occupancy

enum map + known-FP floor exemption) adds vectors under VP-HOOK-025 / VP-HOOK-026 but NO new mutant (architect §8.27
item 3 — the raw-CRITICAL/raw-MEDIUM validate_enums deny is the direct consequence the vectors assert; the
floor-exemption is architectural policy, not a control-flow security branch).** **v1.16 (pass-13) adds TWO mutants

the 'PRISM-456' charset example; `grep -rn 'SM-52\|SM-53' .factory/` returned no match; next free = SM-52/SM-53):

| Mutant | Target construct | Mutation | Killed by |

| SM-28 | monitoring-loop stage-order (document-before-action) | **stage-order-inverted** (ADV-F2-P2-001) — execute Stage 8 TICKET ACTION (`jr` Bash) BEFORE the Stage 7 DOCUMENT verdict Write, so no marker exists when require-review evaluates the jr call | VP-HOOK-027 negative leg (jr Bash with empty marker dir → DENY); positive leg proves correct order → ALLOW |
| SM-29 | disposition-guard emitter hard-floor asset_type set | **unknown-asset-hard-floor-removed** (ADV-F2-P3-001) — drop `asset_type=='unknown'` from the hard-floor set so a LOW-severity + benign-technique + `asset_type=unknown` + `ticket_action_type=comment` verdict is issued a REGULAR comment marker (defense-in-depth breach on the authorization boundary) | VP-HOOK-026 unknown-asset leg (assert NO regular comment/create/assign-scoped marker for `asset_type=unknown` — a STEP 4 review-upgrade marker is acceptable, a regular autonomous-triage marker is not); the mutant issues a REGULAR comment marker and dies |

**New mutation vector count: 48 (SM-9 … SM-54; SM-32 = SM-32a + SM-32b + SM-32-ext as of v1.9; SM-32a re-targeted + SM-32-ext kill vector re-worded at v1.10; +SM-38/SM-39/SM-40 at v1.10; +SM-41/SM-42 at v1.11; +SM-43 at v1.12; +SM-44/SM-45 at v1.13; +SM-46/SM-47 at v1.14; +SM-48/SM-49/SM-50/SM-51 at v1.15; +SM-52/SM-53 at v1.16; +SM-54 at v1.17).** SM-9..SM-16,
SM-21..SM-22, and SM-29..SM-30 land on the require-review + disposition-guard marker surface — the
CRITICAL authorization boundary (module-criticality: require-review C-12 CRITICAL ≥95%;
monitoring-loop surfaces CRITICAL at per-artifact granularity). SM-12 is the explicit
SEC-009-regression sentinel; SM-21 is the explicit ADV-F2-001 severity/confidence-conflation
sentinel; SM-23 is the ADV-F2-005 hard-floor-ordering sentinel; SM-28 is the ADV-F2-P2-001
document-before-action-ordering sentinel; **SM-29 is the ADV-F2-P3-001 unknown-asset hard-floor
sentinel (the pass-3 CRITICAL) and SM-30 is the ADV-F2-P3-003 artifact-class field-set sentinel.
SM-31 is the ADV-F2-P4-006 enum-membership-bypass sentinel, SM-33 the ADV-F2-P4-005
kill-switch-determinism sentinel, SM-34 the ADV-F2-P4-001 dispatch-collision sentinel (both pass-4
CRITICALs land here); SM-32a is the ADV-F2-P5-001 CRITICAL under-label silent-discard sentinel
(killed by VP-HOOK-029) and SM-32b the ADV-F2-P5-002 MAJOR over-label kill-switch-bypass sentinel
(killed by VP-HOOK-026) — the pass-5 under/over-label duals of the single "hook trusted the
LLM-supplied ticket_action_type" root cause; SM-35 the ADV-F2-P4-010 audit-forgery sentinel.**
**v1.9 (pass-6): SM-32-ext is the ADV-F2-P6-002 CRITICAL step-order sentinel (kill vector re-worded at
v1.10 to the deny-before-kill-switch assertion); SM-36 and SM-37 are the ADV-F2-P6-001 CRITICAL consumer
anti-fungibility sentinels (killed by VP-HOOK-024's STEP 6a exact-type vectors in both directions) — the
fungibility of review vs regular create markers was the pass-6 kill-switch/hard-floor bypass root cause.**
**v1.10 (pass-7): the STEP-4 DENY-THE-WRITE redesign replaces the retired marker-upgrade. SM-38 is the
ADV-F2-P7-001 CRITICAL step4-deny-removed sentinel (silent-allow re-appears; killed by VP-HOOK-029's
deny-path vectors); SM-39 is the ADV-F2-P7-004 MAJOR deny-corrective-reason-removed sentinel (the fail-loud
deny becomes fail-STUCK; killed by VP-HOOK-029's machine-actionable-reason vector); SM-32a is RE-TARGETED to
the ADV-F2-P7-001 "revert-deny-to-retired-upgrade" sentinel (unconsumable in-store marker; killed by
VP-HOOK-029's consumer-boundary vector — the O4 seam-gap guard); SM-40 is the ADV-F2-P7-005 MINOR
step-6a-raw-substring false-deny sentinel (killed by VP-HOOK-024's structural-check false-deny vector).**
**v1.11 (pass-8): SM-41 is the ADV-F2-P8-001 CRITICAL step3-create-review-unbindable-allow sentinel — the
correctly-labeled-yet-unbindable silent-discard residual (killed by VP-HOOK-029's unbindable-deny vectors
9–11; separately killable from SM-38, the STEP-4 under-label deny sentinel); SM-42 is the ADV-F2-P8-002
MAJOR structural_label_check-non-quote-aware sentinel (killed by VP-HOOK-024's QUOTED-form false-deny vector;
separately killable from SM-40, the raw-substring revert). Because bash `[[ =~ ]]` is NOT tail-anchored
(P8-003), step 6a is the SOLE anti-fungibility enforcement point for EC-023 direction A (no step-5 backstop),
so the step-6a mutant family SM-36/SM-37/SM-40/SM-42 lands on a P0-adjacent, NON-REDUNDANT single-point-of-
failure surface — SM-36/SM-37 remain CRITICAL and the whole family MUST be killed at the ≥95% require-review
bar (there is no step-5 redundancy to catch a mis-fired 6a).**
**v1.12 (pass-9): SM-43 is the ADV-F2-P9-001 MAJOR step6a-backslash-escape sentinel — it JOINS the step-6a
anti-fungibility family (now SM-36/SM-37/SM-40/SM-42/SM-43), extending the differential-vs-bash coverage to
the backslash-escape class (`\"` in IN_DOUBLE / `\'` in UNQUOTED) per the O5 standing rule (§0). Because step
6a is the SOLE anti-fungibility enforcement point for EC-023 direction A (no step-5 backstop), SM-43 is
P0-adjacent and MUST be killed at the ≥95% require-review bar (killed by VP-HOOK-024's escaped-quote vector
1a; separately killable from SM-40/SM-42, which do not exercise the backslash-escape class). The P9-007
dedup-gate vector (VP-HOOK-029) is a test-only coverage assertion on the STEP-3 comment-review fallback
deny-reason text — NO mutant is warranted (architect §8.21 item 2; the loop-side dedup-HIT protection is
SM-27's target on VP-SKILL-068).**
**v1.13 (pass-10): SM-44 is the ADV-F2-P10-001 CRITICAL step1a-severity-renormalization sentinel — the O6
trust-basis correction (killed by VP-HOOK-030's per-family SEVERITY-MISMATCH under-report vectors); it lands
on the disposition-guard emitter authorization boundary (STEP 1a, before the hard floor), the same surface as
SM-31 (enum) and SM-21 (severity/confidence-conflation). SM-45 is the ADV-F2-P10-003 MAJOR
writemarker-review-path-allow-without-marker sentinel — the infra-failure silent-discard on the hard-floor
review path (killed by VP-HOOK-029's MARKER-WRITE-FAILED review-path vectors 13/14; separately killable from
SM-41, the STEP-3 null-binding branch, and SM-38, the STEP-4 under-label branch — three distinct fail-closed
branches of the same D-DEC-012 clause-2 invariant). Both are on the CRITICAL disposition-guard emitter surface
and MUST be killed at the ≥95% bar. (VP-SKILL-075's operator-boundary cron-exit-nonzero is guarded by a
behavioral BATS on the wrapper, not a code mutant — the wrapper Gate-2 grep is validated directly; its
Gate-1 `.permission_denials` leg is ASM-015-BLOCKED.)**
**v1.14 (pass-11): SM-46 is the ADV-F2-P11-002 MAJOR highseverity-floor-rekeyed sentinel — it lands on the
disposition-guard `hard_floor_applies()` high-severity floor (keyed on `verdict.scored_priority` field 18 per
P11-002); killed by VP-HOOK-026's detector-LOW/scored-CRIT vector. It is DISTINCT from SM-44 (STEP 1a
severity↔native consistency): the STEP 1a consistency check still passes under SM-46, but the FLOOR is re-keyed
to the wrong field → a CRIT-scored detector-LOW alert bypasses the §3.9 floor. SM-47 is the ADV-F2-P11-004 MAJOR
markdown-routed-into-verdict-emitter sentinel — it lands on the disposition-guard artifact-class router
(investigation-markdown emitter entry); killed by VP-HOOK-031's no-validate_enums-on-markdown / compliant-save
vectors. It is DISTINCT from SM-19/SM-34 (JSON↔markdown dispatch direction): SM-47 keeps JSON→verdict routing
correct but wrongly subjects the MARKDOWN class to the verdict emitter's enum/STEP-1a gates, denying a compliant
12-field investigation at save time. Both are on the CRITICAL disposition-guard emitter surface and MUST be killed
at the ≥95% bar.**
**v1.15 (pass-12): SM-48 is the ADV-F2-P12-001 CRITICAL ticket_id-charset-validation-removed sentinel and SM-49 the
ADV-F2-P12-007 jira_project_key-charset-validation-removed sentinel — both land on the disposition-guard
`command_pattern` construction surface (the O7 interpolation-safety gate, VP-HOOK-032); a removed charset check lets a
metacharacter-laden field broaden the anchored authorization regex (the SEC-009 class), so they land squarely on the
CRITICAL marker-authorization boundary and MUST be killed at the ≥95% require-review bar. SM-48/SM-49 are separately
killable (distinct fields, grammars, and interpolation sites). SM-50 is the ADV-F2-P12-002 CRITICAL
markdown-kill-switch-gate-removed sentinel and SM-51 the ADV-F2-P12-002 CRITICAL markdown non-FP-route-to-review-removed
sentinel — both land on the disposition-guard markdown (Human-Comment) path (VP-HOOK-031); under P13-001 (MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH
eliminated) their killer vectors shift (SM-50: a non-FP markdown under `autonomy=false` wrongly routed to review; SM-51:
a non-FP markdown wrongly getting allow-without-marker instead of review) — both remain on the CRITICAL emitter surface
and MUST be killed at the ≥95% bar. P12-003 (fast-path enum map + known-FP floor exemption) adds VP-HOOK-025/026 vectors
but NO mutant (architect §8.27 item 3 — the raw-CRITICAL/raw-MEDIUM validate_enums deny is the vectors' direct
consequence; the floor exemption is architectural policy).**
**v1.16 (pass-13): SM-52 is the ADV-F2-P13-001 CRITICAL markdown-fp-comment-marker-revert sentinel — reverting the
MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH elimination so an FP markdown issues an unfloored autonomous `["comment"]` marker (killed by
VP-HOOK-031's FP→allow-without-marker vector); SM-53 is the ADV-F2-P13-003 MAJOR markdown-disposition-full-document-substring-scan
sentinel — a defective parse that reads an embedded/negated `Disposition: FP` as FP → allow-without-marker instead of
review (killed by VP-HOOK-031's FP-in-code-fence / negated-FP parse-grammar vectors). Both land on the disposition-guard
markdown (Human-Comment) path (VP-HOOK-031); SM-52 (FP-branch outcome) and SM-53 (disposition parse) are separately
killable from each other and from SM-50/SM-51 (kill-switch gate / non-FP routing branch), so they MUST be killed at the
≥95% bar. P13-004 (historical-total annotation) and the PRISMDEMO sweep add no mutant.**
**v1.17 (pass-14): SM-54 is the ADV-F2-P14-002 MAJOR setup-time-charset-validation-removed sentinel — it lands on the
activate + onboard-customer SKILL setup-flow `jira_project_key` charset gate (VP-SKILL-076, the PREVENTIVE gate), NOT the
disposition-guard hook surface. Killed by VP-SKILL-076's reject-at-setup vector (a hyphenated `PRISM-DEMO` fed to activate /
onboard-customer must HALT with a user-facing error and write no partial state). It is DISTINCT from SM-49 (VP-HOOK-032, the
RUNTIME command_pattern jira_project_key charset gate): SM-54 is the setup-time preventive call-site (a config-entry gate on
the helper scripts), SM-49 the runtime command_pattern deny inside disposition-guard — the two together close the class
end-to-end. VP-SKILL-076/SM-54 sit on the activate/onboard-customer setup surface (module-criticality HIGH ≥90% target — the
setup helpers, sibling to VP-SKILL-051 prism-version-check.sh); the NVD sweep (P14-001 propagation) added no mutant.**
With SM-9..SM-16 + SM-21..SM-22 + SM-28 + SM-29..SM-30 + **SM-31, SM-32a, SM-32b, SM-32-ext, SM-33..SM-53**
KILLED, the marker/authorization path meets the **≥95% require-review** target (SM-31/32a/32b/32-ext/33/34/38/39/41/**44/45/46/47/48/49/50/51/52/53**
land squarely on the disposition-guard emitter authorization boundary — **SM-44 on STEP 1a consistency, SM-45 on WRITE_MARKER review-path fail-closed, SM-46 on the scored_priority high-severity floor, SM-47 on the investigation-markdown emitter-entry router, SM-48/SM-49 on the O7 command_pattern charset-validation gate, SM-50/SM-51/SM-52 on the markdown Human-Comment kill-switch/non-FP-routing/FP-branch path, SM-53 on the markdown disposition-parse grammar**; SM-35/36/37/40/42/43 on the require-review
consumer + audit surface); **SM-54 lands on the activate/onboard-customer setup-flow charset gate (VP-SKILL-076, HIGH ≥90%);** SM-17..SM-20 + SM-23..SM-27 carry the disposition-guard JSON path, the
update-jira never-reopen guard (SM-26), and the monitoring-loop enforcement + dedup surface (SM-27) to
**≥90%**.

## 5. Test-Count Delta per BC (F3 story-sizing input)

Estimates are new **BATS test cases** (hooks.bats / skills.bats / integration.bats). Each new
`.sh`-backed behavior also requires a `.ps1` parity test (CONV-004); parity additions are
tracked separately and roughly mirror the hook/helper behavioral count.

the "un-bypassable" claim is withdrawn (native_severity/sensor_family are LLM-supplied; ASM-008-DEFERRED, symmetric with

**+2 on BC-9.01.001** (VP-SKILL-059 structural→behavioral upgrade — P10-005: prism-DTU multi-org + static
hunt-query-library org_slug parse). Plus **~6 parity** (the STEP 1a SEVERITY-MISMATCH, WRITE_MARKER
review-path fail-closed, and cron-wrapper Gate-2 branches each need `.ps1` siblings per CONV-004; the
cron wrapper is bash-only so its parity is minimal). The two new v1.13 mutants — **SM-44**
(step1a-severity-renormalization-reverted, CRITICAL, VP-HOOK-030) and **SM-45** (writemarker-review-path-
allow-without-marker-reverted, MAJOR, VP-HOOK-029) — both land on the CRITICAL disposition-guard authorization
boundary (STEP 1a re-normalization + WRITE_MARKER review-path fail-closed), so they join the near-exhaustive
input-partition BATS on the marker path. **P10-001 (O6): VP-HOOK-030 is the O6 compliance artifact — the
hard floor now keys on the hook-recomputed severity, un-bypassable for the severity dimension.** The prior **v1.12 pass-9 remediation** was a net

mutant (**SM-43** step6a-in_double-backslash-escape-reverted) lands on the CRITICAL require-review step-6a
anti-fungibility surface (the SOLE EC-023 direction-A gate post-P8-003), so it joins the near-exhaustive
input-partition BATS on the marker path. **P9-001/P9-009 (O5): VP-HOOK-024 is now the O5 compliance artifact —
its differential-vs-bash partition covers single/double (P8-002), unquoted, and backslash-escape (P9-001)
classes; equals-form is scoped OUT (jr has no `--label=` form). The step-6a mutant family is now
SM-36/37/40/42/43, all P0-adjacent.** The prior **v1.11 pass-8 remediation** was a

SM-41 kill: create-review + null jira_project_key → HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE deny; comment-review + null
ticket_id + fallback hint; comment-review + both null). **BC-3.01.001 is +0 BATS** — the P8-002 fix UPDATES
the existing v1.10 step-6a false-deny vector to the QUOTED form (that single vector now kills BOTH SM-40 and
SM-42), it does NOT add a new test. Plus **~1 parity** (the STEP-3 `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` deny branch needs
a `.ps1` sibling per CONV-004). The v1.11 mutants (**SM-41** step3-create-review-unbindable-allow, **SM-42**
structural_label_check-non-quote-aware) both land on the CRITICAL disposition-guard/require-review
authorization path (the STEP-3 fail-loud deny + step-6a anti-fungibility), so these remain near-exhaustive
input-partition BATS on the marker path. **P8-003 raises the stakes on the step-6a family: with no step-5
tail-anchor backstop, step 6a is the SOLE anti-fungibility enforcement point (EC-023 direction A), so the
SM-36/37/40/42 mutant family is P0-adjacent/non-redundant and MUST be killed.**
The prior **v1.10 pass-7 remediation** was a net **+3 BATS**: +1 BC-3.01.001 (step-6a structural false-deny —
P7-005, SM-40) and +2 BC-10.01.001 (VP-HOOK-029 DENY-THE-WRITE re-scope net −1 [three v1.9 marker-upgrade
vectors RETIRED] + VP-SKILL-074 Cyberint partition +3). The prior v1.9 pass-6 remediation added +16 BATS
(+2 BC-3.01.001 consumer STEP 6a anti-fungibility, +14 BC-10.01.001). This is consistent with the
CRITICAL/HIGH rigor bar in module-criticality.md (near-exhaustive input-partition BATS on the marker
path). F3 should size Wave-3 (marker mechanism), Wave-7 (monitoring-loop), the update-jira story, and
the investigate-event / assess-priority stories to absorb the BC-3.01.001 + BC-3.03.001 +
BC-10.01.001 + BC-4.02.001 + BC-4.05.001 + BC-5.01.001 test load (~115 of the ~155 new cases
concentrate on the hook/marker + org_slug surfaces — the pass-4 additions are almost entirely on the
disposition-guard emitter + require-review marker path).

## 6. Verification Strategy Notes (cross-cutting)

- **jr-mock** backs all VP-SKILL-060/061/062 and the ASM-009 integration tests (ticket
  create/comment/list JQL responses) so tests never touch a live Jira; **prism-DTU-demo-server**
  (`--config-dir <tmpdir>` mandatory per architecture-delta §Testing-Architecture) backs
  VP-SKILL-050/056/061 sensor/row/health fixtures.
- Every prism-invoking test MUST call the mandated `assert_prism_config_dir_set` helper and
  set `PRISM_CONFIG_DIR=$(mktemp -d)` in `setup()` to avoid corrupting the developer's real
  prism config.
- VP-HOOK-024/026 and the ASM-009 test share the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA=$(mktemp -d)` env-var
  fixture (answer (c)); marker-store isolation per test prevents cross-test bleed.
- The D-DEC-003 `--bare`-absent and D-DEC-010 allowlist-matches-SKILL assertions are pure
  structural greps over `run-monitoring-loop.sh` — cheap, high-value SEC guards folded into
  BC-10.01.001's count.
- **VP-SKILL-064 (org_slug scoping — the sole plugin-side cross-tenant isolation guarantee,
  D-DEC-005) uses three complementary legs:** (i) a prism-DTU-demo-server multi-org fixture with
  three orgs (org-a / org-b / org-c) seeded with distinguishable rows — a query issued in the
  org-a FOR-EACH context must return ZERO org-b/org-c rows (behavioral isolation proof);
  (ii) a static/structural check that the loop's PrismQL construction ALWAYS injects an
  `org_slug` constraint matching the current org context (grep the query-builder path — no
  code path emits a query without the constraint); (iii) an adversarial fixture that attempts an
  unscoped query — the loop must reject or auto-scope it, never issue it bare. This is the
  monitoring-loop analogue of the sibling structural VP-SKILL-059 (scan-threats), but promoted to
  a behavioral+adversarial integration property because the loop is autonomous (no human in the
  query-construction path). Mutant SM-24 (org_slug-drop) is the paired kill target.
- **VP-SKILL-065 (autonomy_enabled kill switch — Inv#11) — RE-SCOPED v1.9 (ADV-F2-P6-003 MAJOR / D-DEC-012
  Option A).** The pass-1 scope ("ZERO markers consumed AND ZERO `jr issue create/comment/assign` calls
  under `autonomy_enabled=false`") directly contradicted the human-confirmed Option A + EC-006/EC-014: a
  silent-sensor / Indeterminate (hard-floor) run WILL issue a `jr issue create … --label BLIND-SPOT`
  escalation write under the kill switch (that write IS the human-surface mechanism; suppressing it would
  silence the finding). VP-SKILL-065 is therefore **re-scoped, not silently FINALIZED — re-marked PROPOSED**
  this pass. The BATS integration test with `autonomy_enabled=false` injected now asserts, on a **regular
  (non-hard-floor FP)** verdict: the marker dir contains no consumed (`.used`) **REGULAR** markers AND the
  jr-mock spy records **zero REGULAR** `jr issue create/comment/assign` invocations, while evidence
  collection + verdict construction + Jira drafting still proceed (a `propose-only`-annotated draft is
  written); and, on a **silent-sensor (hard-floor)** verdict, a `create-review` marker IS emitted and the
  jr-mock spy DOES record the review escalation write (kill-switch EXEMPT via the STEP 3 correct-label
  review path, which runs before the STEP 5 kill switch; an under-labeled hard-floor verdict is denied at
  STEP 4 so the loop re-documents with the review token). This is the positive companion to VP-HOOK-026
  (which proves hard floors block REGULAR markers regardless of `autonomy_enabled=true`); VP-SKILL-065
  proves the global-off path halts only REGULAR autonomous writes. Mutant SM-25 (kill-switch-ignore) is the
  paired kill target for the REGULAR-suppression leg.
- **VP-HOOK-027 (stage-order document-before-action — P1 cross-hook, NEW v1.2) reuses the ASM-009
  cross-hook harness (answer (b))** but tests the *ordering* rather than single-use: the property
  is that require-review DENIES a Stage-8 `jr` write unless a Stage-7 verdict Write already caused
  disposition-guard to emit a matching scoped marker within the 120s TTL. The negative leg
  (`jr` Bash first, empty marker dir → deny) is the empirical guard the adversary said was missing
  (ADV-F2-P2-014) and would have caught the inverted-stage CRITICAL (ADV-F2-P2-001). Mutant SM-28
  (stage-order-inverted) is the paired kill target. This VP does NOT assert the monitoring-loop
  SKILL's internal stage numbering (that is a SKILL-prose/PO concern); it asserts the *hook-enforced
  consequence* of getting the order wrong — which is why it lives in VP-HOOK, not VP-SKILL.
- **VP-SKILL-066/067 (update-jira never-reopen + SLA surface, NEW v1.2)** are the missing
  update-jira-path guards (ADV-F2-P2-009a/b). VP-SKILL-062 asserts never-reopen on the autonomous
  monitoring-loop path; VP-SKILL-066 asserts it on the analyst-facing update-jira path (jr-mock
  Resolved→propose-only-halt, Closed→create-new+link, plus a static grep that no code path emits
  `jr issue move` out of Closed/Resolved — directly realizing BC-4.02.001 §Refactoring-Notes'
  stated formal-verification target). VP-SKILL-067 asserts every append/link/propose-reopen action
  emits the explicit SLA-impact statement, defaulting to "SLA: unknown — do not assume compliant"
  when `jr issue view` yields no SLA data. Mutant SM-26 (reopen-guard-removed) pairs with
  VP-SKILL-066.
- **VP-SKILL-068 (grace-window + Jira-first dedup, NEW v1.2)** closes the D-DEC-002 coverage gap
  (ADV-F2-P2-009c): VP-SKILL-050 tests only that the watermark is monotonic; VP-SKILL-068 tests
  that the *grace window's* re-fetch of late/out-of-order OCSF events does not double-ticket.
  prism-DTU seeds an event with normalized `_time` inside `[watermark − WATERMARK_GRACE_SECONDS,
  watermark]`; jr-mock returns an existing open ticket for it → assert the loop appends a comment
  (Stage-2 Jira-first dedup, D-DEC-002 §"Jira-first dedup") and does NOT `jr issue create`. Mutant
  SM-27 (dedup-check-removed→double-ticket) is the paired kill target: with dedup off, the
  re-fetched event creates a duplicate and the mutant dies.
- **VP-HOOK-026 unknown-asset leg (NEW v1.3, ADV-F2-P3-001 CRITICAL)** extends the existing
  hard-floor family with `asset_type=unknown`. The adversary's finding was a mis-propagation on the
  authorization boundary: BC-10.01.001 v1.9 Inv#10 policy already made `unknown` a conservative hard
  floor, but the disposition-guard emitter list (BC-3.03.001 Inv#4) and the `hard_floor_applies()`
  pseudocode omitted it, so a LOW-severity + benign + `asset_type=unknown` verdict with a SKILL-side
  `ticket_action_type!=none` label would get a REGULAR (autonomous-triage) marker → auto-write. The BATS
  test injects exactly that benign-but-unknown verdict with `autonomy_enabled=true` and **[UPDATED v1.8]**
  asserts NO regular (comment/create/assign-scoped) marker is written — a `create-review`/`comment-review`
  STEP-4 DENY-THE-WRITE of an under-labeled hard-floor verdict is acceptable (its fail-loud completeness is
  owned by VP-HOOK-029); what VP-HOOK-026 forbids is a regular autonomous-triage marker. Mutant SM-29
  (unknown-asset-hard-floor-removed) is the paired kill target (it issues a regular comment marker and
  dies). This is a pure hook-side guarantee (defense-in-depth independent of SKILL.md), which is why it
  stays on VP-HOOK-026.
- **VP-HOOK-025 12-vs-15 artifact-class split + confidence float→enum legs (NEW v1.3,
  ADV-F2-P3-003/P3-008)** close two VP-coverage seams the adversary flagged (ADV-F2-P3-013). The
  split makes the field-set an explicit per-class test axis: the investigation-markdown class checks
  the 12 ICD-203 headings ONLY (a valid 12-field investigation → allow; a spurious Severity heading →
  still allow, no wrong-class 18-field deny), while the verdict-JSON class checks all 18. Mutant SM-30
  (artifact-class-over-strict — apply the 18-field set to investigation markdown) dies on the
  investigation-12-field-accept test — this guards the ADV-F2-P3-003 regression where 18-field
  validation on investigation markdown would break the investigate-event DI-013 marker path. The
  float→enum legs assert disposition-guard's field#2 enum type-assertion DENIES a float `confidence`
  (e.g. `0.85`) and ALLOWS the three enum values — the hook-side backstop for D-DEC-011.
- **VP-HOOK-028 (verdict-path reachability — NEW v1.3, ADV-F2-P3-005) reuses the ASM-009 cross-hook
  harness (answer (b))** to prove the load-bearing verdict-file-path naming convention (BC-10.01.001
  Stage-7 PC#8). Because disposition-guard fast-path-allows any Write whose path lacks the `verdict`
  substring (no ICD-203 validation, no marker), a mis-named Stage-7 write silently emits no marker, and
  require-review then DENIES every downstream Stage-8 `jr` write (nothing to consume). The negative leg
  (Write to `artifacts/findings/alert-001.json` → empty marker dir → jr deny) proves the failure mode
  is fail-closed (action denied), and the positive control (`.../verdict-alert-001.json` → marker → jr
  allow) proves the convention is what gates reachability. No paired mutant is assigned (the property is
  a naming-convention reachability check on the fast-path branch, covered by SM-19's dual-path router
  mutant family); the value is the explicit reachability seam that had no owning VP.
- **VP-SKILL-069/070 (investigate-event + assess-priority org_slug scoping — NEW v1.3,
  ADV-F2-P3-004)** extend the D-DEC-005 tenant-isolation guarantee to the two remaining autonomous/
  semi-autonomous PrismQL surfaces the adversary found uncovered: VP-SKILL-064 covered only the
  monitoring-loop and VP-SKILL-059 only scan-threats. Both use the VP-SKILL-064 three-leg pattern —
  (i) static Iron-Law content assertion that every PrismQL block in the owning SKILL.md carries a
  `WHERE org_slug=` constraint (VP-SKILL-069: Stage-3 OCSF + temporal-adjacency; VP-SKILL-070:
  PC#5a/5b/5d); (ii) a prism-DTU multi-org fixture asserting an org-a query returns zero org-b/c rows;
  (iii) an adversarial unscoped-query fixture that must be rejected/scoped. VP-SKILL-069 leans more
  static (investigate-event is analyst-driven), VP-SKILL-070 pairs static + DTU behavioral. No new
  mutant beyond the existing SM-24 org_slug-drop pattern (the same mutation class applied per surface).
- **VP-SKILL-071 (assess-priority confidence float→enum consistency — NEW v1.3, ADV-F2-P3-008 /
  D-DEC-011)** is the producer-side companion to VP-HOOK-025's enum type-assertion. Architecture-delta
  §8.9 item 4 proposed a proptest/hypothesis property test, but this plugin's stack is declarative
  bash (no proptest — see `verification_stack`), so the property is realized as a BATS
  boundary/equivalence-partition test over the D-DEC-011 thresholds: `confidence_score` at and around
  0.75 and 0.40 must map to the correct enum (`0.75→high`, `0.749→medium`, `0.40→medium`, `0.399→low`,
  endpoints inclusive to the higher tier), and an inconsistent pair (`0.85`/`low`) is flagged invalid.
  This guarantees the enum handed to verdict field #2 is well-formed before disposition-guard
  (VP-HOOK-025) type-asserts it — the two VPs are complementary halves of the D-DEC-011 contract.
- **VP-HOOK-024 create-pattern injection-safety + audit sanitization (NEW v1.5, ADV-F2-P4-002
  CRITICAL / P4-010).** The pass-4 adversary showed the v1.4 create `command_pattern`
  `^jr (--output json )?issue create .*--project <key>` was defeated two ways: (a) the unbounded
  `.*` let an attacker-influenceable `--summary "…--project ORG_A…"` satisfy the `--project ORG_A`
  substring while the command actually targeted `--project ORG_B` (cross-org create bypass); (b) no
  trailing boundary let `--project PROD` prefix-match `--project PRODUCTION`. v1.5's tests pin the
  anchored fixed-position pattern `^jr (--output json )?issue create --project <key>( |$)` (`--project`
  first, trailing space-or-EOL) and assert the two attack commands DENY. The P4-010 leg asserts a `\n`
  embedded in `ticket_id` (Jira-content-influenced) cannot forge a second MARKER_USED audit line —
  `ticket_id`/`org_slug`/`op` are control-char-stripped (`tr -d '\000-\037'`) like the base64 command.
  These are consumer/emitter-side hook behaviors (require-review anchored match + audit; disposition-guard
  create-emitter pattern), so they stay on VP-HOOK-024. Mutant SM-35 (control-char-strip-removed) is the
  audit-forgery kill target; the injection legs kill the retired-`.*` regression class directly.
- **VP-HOOK-025 validate_enums() membership gate (NEW v1.5, ADV-F2-P4-006).** The adversary found the
  verdict-JSON check was key-presence-only while `hard_floor_applies()` keys on exact-string membership,
  so a case-mangled `severity:"High"` passed presence, silently missed the `∈{HIGH,CRITICAL}` membership
  test, escaped the hard floor, and got a marker for an actually-HIGH alert. v1.5 adds a
  `validate_enums(verdict)` step that runs BEFORE the hard-floor check and fail-closed-DENIES any
  non-member value on all six typed fields (severity, asset_type, disposition, sensor_health_status,
  ticket_action_type, confidence). Fail-closed DENY is deliberate — allow-without-marker would let a
  field-mangled verdict write to the investigation store without an ICD-203 guarantee. Mutant SM-31
  (validate_enums-removed) is the paired kill target.
- **VP-HOOK-026 review-surfacing + kill-switch determinism (extended v1.5, D-DEC-012 / ADV-F2-P4-004 /
  P4-005).** Two pass-4 corrections extend the hard-floor family without weakening it: (i) the D-DEC-012
  `create-review`/`comment-review` marker types are EXEMPT from the hard-floor no-marker rule and the
  kill switch (emitter Step 3 correct-label review path runs before the Step 5 kill switch; an under-labeled
  hard-floor verdict is denied at Step 4 — also before Step 5 — per the v1.10 deny-the-Write redesign, so the loop re-documents; both stay ahead of the Step 5 kill
  switch — post the ADV-F2-P6-002 reorder) because a `[REVIEW-REQUIRED]`/`[BLIND-SPOT]` ticket is human
  ESCALATION, not autonomous triage — new legs assert a hard-floor verdict WITH `create-review` DOES get
  a restricted marker (`authorized_operations=["create-review"]`), even under `autonomy_enabled=false`;
  (ii) the kill switch is read DIRECTLY by disposition-guard from the verdict's `autonomy_enabled`
  operational field (P4-005) rather than trusting the loop LLM to set `ticket_action_type=none`, so
  `autonomy_enabled≠true` (false OR absent→conservative false) suppresses ALL REGULAR markers. The
  original unconditional-hard-floor legs (Indeterminate/HIGH/critical-asset/unknown/T1003/degraded) are
  UNCHANGED for regular markers. Mutant SM-33 (autonomy_enabled-clause-removed → regular marker under
  kill switch) is the paired kill target for the kill-switch legs.
  **[EXTENDED v1.8 — over-label gate, ADV-F2-P5-002 MAJOR.]** Pass-4 treated the review-token exemption
  as UNCONDITIONAL on the LLM-supplied `ticket_action_type`; the adversary (P5-002) showed this let the
  LLM manufacture a kill-switch + hard-floor bypass by over-labeling a regular verdict as `create-review`.
  The architect's D-DEC-008 STEP 3 fix GATES the exemption on the hook-computed `hard_floor_applies(verdict)`
  (`IF NOT hard_floor_applies(): emit allow WITHOUT marker; RETURN`). New v1.8 over-label legs assert a
  NON-hard-floor verdict (disposition=TP, LOW severity, standard asset) carrying a review token gets NO
  marker — incl. under `autonomy_enabled=false` (no kill-switch bypass). The paired kill target is the
  RE-SCOPED **SM-32b** (step3-hard-floor-gate-removed → a non-hard-floor verdict with a review token gets
  the exempt marker; the over-label legs assert NO marker, so it dies). The review-surfacing positive
  controls (hard_floor_applies()=TRUE → marker emitted) remain valid under the gated STEP 3. This is the
  over-label dual of the VP-HOOK-029 under-label fail-loud invariant (SM-32a) — the two together close the
  P5-001/P5-002 single root cause (the hook trusting the LLM token without cross-checking hard_floor_applies).
- **VP-HOOK-028 JSON-first canonical-path dispatch (extended v1.5, ADV-F2-P4-001 CRITICAL).** The pass-3
  fix (mandate `verdict` in the Stage-7 path) collided with the canonical path
  `artifacts/investigations/verdict-<id>-<iso_ts>.json`, which contains BOTH `investigation` and `verdict`
  substrings. A plain "check `investigation` first" router misroutes the canonical verdict JSON to the
  12-field markdown branch → heading assertions fail → DENY → no marker → the entire autonomous pipeline
  is unreachable (the P4-001 CRITICAL). v1.5 pins the JSON-first dispatch order this doc already specified
  (JSON-content/`.json` → 18-field verdict path REGARDLESS of the `investigation` substring; `*investigation-*.md`
  → 12-field; else fast-path) as an explicit VP-HOOK-028 regression leg: `.../verdict-alert-001.json` →
  18-field path → marker (positive, NOT misrouted); `.../investigation-001.md` → 12-field. Mutant SM-34
  (dispatch-order-inverted) is the paired kill target. BC-3.03.001 v1.13 PC#1/2/3 own the rewritten dispatch.
- **VP-HOOK-029 end-to-end consumer-boundary fail-loud invariant (NEW v1.5; RE-SCOPED v1.8/v1.9; re-scoped
  END-TO-END + re-FINALIZED v1.10, P0, D-DEC-012 / ADV-F2-P7-001 CRITICAL / P7-004 MAJOR — O4 standing rule).**
  This is the closure of the mutual exclusion the adversary flagged: BC-10.01.001 v1.7 Inv#10 forced
  hard-floor verdicts to `ticket_action_type=none` (no marker), while EC-006/EC-014 required the loop to
  create `[BLIND-SPOT]` / `[REVIEW-REQUIRED]` tickets — so in unattended cron a hard-floor verdict was
  silently dropped. **Passes 5–6 (historical):** the fix deterministically UPGRADED an under-labeled
  hard-floor verdict to a `create-review`/`comment-review` marker at STEP 4 (moved before the STEP 5 kill
  switch at pass-6), with kill-switch-ON vectors added. **Pass-7 root cause + redesign (P7-001 CRITICAL):**
  the STEP-4 marker-*upgrade* was proved STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND — disposition-guard can rewrite the marker but
  NOT the loop's future Bash command. Under-labeling means the loop set a non-review `ticket_action_type` and
  will run the corresponding non-review command; the upgraded `create-review` marker requires `--label` in
  fixed second position, so for 3 of 4 under-label action types (create/assign/none) the loop's own command
  cannot match the upgraded marker's `command_pattern` → require-review DENIES the Stage-8 jr → **no ticket
  is ever created** and the CRITICAL finding is invisible to the analyst (only an audit line records it).
  The upgrade merely *moved* the silent drop from "no marker" to "marker present but structurally
  unconsumable by the command." **The mechanism is RETIRED; new STEP 4 = DENY-THE-WRITE:** disposition-guard
  DENIES the under-labeled verdict Write itself with a structured machine-readable corrective reason
  (`hard_floor_trigger`, `required_token` [create-review if ticket_id null, else comment-review],
  `label_instruction`, `instruction`) + an **UNDER-LABEL-DENIED** audit entry; NO marker; the loop
  re-documents with the required review token; on the corrected Write, STEP 3 issues the review marker
  normally. Non-termination is bounded fail-closed — the deny + audit ARE the loud failure; a loop that never
  re-documents is a BC-10.01.001 conformance defect, detectable by VP-HOOK-029's consumer-boundary
  assertion. STEP 4 still precedes the STEP 5 kill switch, so the deny fires regardless of
  `autonomy_enabled`. **Pass-7 verification gap (P7-004 MAJOR — O4):** the v1.9 VP-HOOK-029 assertion was
  EMITTER-ONLY ("a marker exists OR an error artifact was written"), which is satisfied even by an
  unconsumable marker — it could NOT detect the Write→Bash seam gap. Per the **O4 standing rule (§0)**,
  VP-HOOK-029 is re-scoped to assert the CONSUMER-BOUNDARY outcome: for ANY `ticket_action_type`, either
  (a) a review-token verdict yields a marker AND a correctly-labeled jr write that is authorized and
  CONSUMABLE at consumer STEP 6a (the escalation jr write actually occurs), or (b) a non-review-token verdict
  is DENIED at STEP 4 with a machine-actionable corrective reason + UNDER-LABEL-DENIED audit — NEVER a marker
  the loop's own command cannot consume, NEVER a silent allow. The consumer-boundary vectors (create-review
  marker + correctly-labeled jr → ALLOW; create-review marker + no-`--label` jr → DENY) are the O4 seam-gap
  guard; the kill-switch-irrelevance vector asserts the deny fires with `autonomy_enabled` true AND false.
  Reuses the ASM-009 cross-hook harness (disposition-guard emit → require-review consume + STEP 6a label
  match, BC-3.01.001 v1.19 step 6/6a). **Lifecycle: re-marked PROPOSED pending the deny-path vector set, then
  re-FINALIZED (P0) v1.10 per architecture-delta §8.17 item 1** — the convergence-blocking safety invariant
  is no longer deferred to F6. **The three v1.9 STEP-4 upgrade-marker vectors + the UNDER-LABEL-CORRECTED
  audit assertion are RETIRED (reason "mechanism removed ADV-F2-P7-001"; history preserved). Paired mutants:
  SM-38 (remove the STEP-4 deny → silent allow) killed by the deny-path vectors; SM-39 (remove the
  corrective-reason structure → deny fires but the loop cannot act) killed by the machine-actionable-reason
  vector; SM-32a (RE-TARGETED: revert the deny to the retired GOTO-WRITE_MARKER upgrade → unconsumable
  in-store marker) killed by the consumer-boundary unconsumable vector; SM-32-ext (revert STEP 4/5 order)
  killed by the kill-switch-irrelevance vector; all disjoint from SM-32b (over-label, killed by VP-HOOK-026).**
  **[EXTENDED v1.11 — STEP-3 correctly-labeled-yet-unbindable deny, ADV-F2-P8-001 CRITICAL / D-DEC-012
  clause 2.]** Passes 5–7 hardened the UNDER-LABEL axis (non-review token) exhaustively; the adversary
  (P8-001) found the dual residual on the CORRECTLY-LABELED review path. When the loop supplies a genuinely
  hard-floor verdict with a CORRECT review token but a null non-ICD-203 operational binding field
  (`create-review` + null/empty `jira_project_key`; `comment-review` + null `ticket_id`), the pre-P8-001
  STEP 3 hit `emit allow without marker; RETURN` — a silent allow with no marker, no deny, no audit. Because
  `jira_project_key`/`ticket_id` are in neither the 18-field presence check nor `validate_enums()`, the
  verdict cleared every prior gate and the hard-floor finding was silently dropped (the P5-001/P7-001 pattern,
  verbatim, on the review path). The redesigned D-DEC-008 STEP 3 replaces BOTH silent-allow branches with a
  **`HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` DENY-THE-WRITE**: WRITE a `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` audit entry naming the
  `missing_field`, emit `deny` with a structured corrective reason (`hard_floor_trigger`, `missing_field`,
  re-issue instruction; the comment-review branch adds a create-review fallback hint when `jira_project_key`
  IS present — mirroring the STEP-4 `required_token` logic). So the gated STEP-3 review path now yields
  exactly one of {a bindable review marker, a `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` deny} — NEVER a silent allow. This is
  ADDITIVE to VP-HOOK-029's §2 deny-path set (the VP stays FINALIZED P0 — an EXTENSION, not a re-scope): new
  consumer-observable vectors 9–11 assert the deny + audit + fallback hint. Bounded non-termination mirrors
  STEP 4 — one `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` audit entry + one deny per re-doc attempt, no Jira write, no silent
  loop (the pass-9 non-termination concern the adversary flagged is discharged by the bounded fail-closed
  analysis). Paired mutant **SM-41** (revert the STEP-3 create-review null-`jira_project_key` branch to
  emit-allow-without-marker) killed by vectors 9–11; separately killable from SM-38 (the STEP-4 under-label
  deny sentinel) — distinct branches, distinct code, distinct vectors.
- **VP-HOOK-024 consumer STEP 6a anti-fungibility (NEW v1.9, ADV-F2-P6-001 CRITICAL).** The adversary showed
  that `create` and `create-review` markers had byte-identical `command_pattern`s and the consumer accepted
  either token for a `jr issue create`, so a `create-review` escalation marker could authorize a regular
  autonomous create (and vice versa) — a kill-switch + hard-floor bypass whenever a hard-floor verdict
  coexisted with a regular write in the same run. D-DEC-012's Alternatives-Rejected is REVERSED: hook-side
  label enforcement is now ADOPTED (a security control cannot live only in the untrusted SKILL.md Iron Law).
  The create-review `command_pattern` now encodes `--label (REVIEW-REQUIRED|BLIND-SPOT)` in FIXED second
  position after `--project <key>` (`^jr (--output json )?issue create --project <key> --label
  (REVIEW-REQUIRED|BLIND-SPOT)( |$)`), and require-review STEP 6a cross-checks BOTH directions: a
  `["create-review"]` marker is refused for a command lacking a review label (named vector
  `create-review-marker-requires-review-label`, kills SM-36), and a `["create"]` marker is refused for a
  command carrying a review label (named vector `create-marker-rejects-review-label`, kills SM-37); correct
  pairings consume normally (EC-023). `has_review_label` is a structural property of the command, not Jira
  content; the comment/comment-review structural `--label` check pends ASM-014, with ticket_id binding + Iron
  Law as the interim comment-review guard. This also mitigates P6-004 (single shared `PRISMDEMO` project key
  makes per-org create-marker isolation infeasible; the review-label binding + single-use + TTL are the
  primary cross-org protection for create-review operations).
  **[EXTENDED v1.10 — STEP 6a structural-check false-deny prevention, ADV-F2-P7-005 MINOR / D-DEC-001
  `structural_label_check`.]** The adversary showed the v1.9 `has_review_label` was an UNANCHORED raw
  substring test over the whole command, which includes the LLM/attacker-influenceable `--summary` text: a
  benign FP-close create such as `jr issue create --project PRISMDEMO --summary "rule matched literal --label
  REVIEW-REQUIRED in payload"` passes step-5's anchored regular-create pattern but then step-6a set
  `has_review_label=true` against its `["create"]` marker → the legitimate create was FALSE-DENIED. This is a
  content-vs-structure defect: the anchored step-5 `command_pattern` is the gate that verifies the command
  is a genuine `jr issue create` for THIS `["create"]` marker, so step-6a's over-eager substring match only
  produced false-denies (fail-closed, not a bypass). The pass-7 fix made step-6a STRUCTURAL —
  `structural_label_check(cmd)` returns true only when `--label` appears as a standalone token immediately
  preceding `REVIEW-REQUIRED`/`BLIND-SPOT`.
  **[EXTENDED v1.11 — QUOTE-AWARE tokenizer, ADV-F2-P8-002 MAJOR / D-DEC-001.]** The adversary (P8-002) showed
  the pass-7 `split_on_whitespace` was STILL defective: the hook receives `tool_input.command` as the RAW
  command string with literal quote characters (`jq -r`, no shell expansion has occurred), and a naive
  whitespace split of EC-024's own example — `jr issue create --project PRISMDEMO --summary "rule matched
  literal --label REVIEW-REQUIRED in alert payload"` — yields `--label` as a standalone token immediately
  followed by `REVIEW-REQUIRED` → `structural_label_check` returns true → the legitimate create is STILL
  false-denied. The D-DEC-001 fix replaces `split_on_whitespace` with a QUOTE-AWARE state-machine tokenizer
  (UNQUOTED/IN_SINGLE/IN_DOUBLE) that keeps a quoted region as one token: the tokenizer enters IN_DOUBLE at
  the opening `"` before "rule", so the whole `--summary` value is a single token and there is NO standalone
  `--label` token. Named vector `regular-create-with-label-literal-in-summary-allowed` (updated to the QUOTED
  form explicitly): the `["create"]` marker + that quoted-`--summary` create → `has_review_label=false` →
  **ALLOW** (not a false-deny). Paired mutants: **SM-40** (revert to the raw-substring check) and **SM-42**
  (revert to non-quote-aware `split_on_whitespace`); the SINGLE quoted-form vector SEPARATELY kills both —
  SM-40 because the raw substring matches inside the quoted region, SM-42 because whitespace-splitting breaks
  the quoted value into a standalone `--label` token (distinct failure mechanisms, same vector).
  **[P8-003 MINOR — step-6a is the SOLE anti-fungibility enforcement point.]** The adversary corrected a false
  claim (EC-023 direction A / the create generation-table note) that the regular create pattern
  `^jr … issue create --project KEY( |$)` REJECTS a review-labeled create at step 5. Bash `[[ =~ ]]` is NOT
  tail-anchored: for `jr issue create --project PRISMDEMO --label REVIEW-REQUIRED …` the regex matches the
  prefix up to the space after `PRISMDEMO`, so **step 5 PASSES**. `( |$)` guards ONLY against project-KEY
  prefix extension (`PROD` ≠ `PRODUCTION`, its P4-002 purpose) — it is NOT a review/regular defense-in-depth
  backstop. Therefore the create/create-review anti-fungibility (EC-023 direction A) rests EXCLUSIVELY on
  step-6a `structural_label_check`; there is no step-5 redundancy. The correction is a BC-3.01.001 EC-023 body
  edit (PO-owned, §8.18) — verification-delta carries no current-body step-5-defense-in-depth claim to retract
  — but it RAISES the criticality of the step-6a mutant family: SM-36/SM-37 (both directions, CRITICAL),
  SM-40 (raw-substring false-deny), and SM-42 (non-quote-aware false-deny) now cover a NON-REDUNDANT single
  point of failure and are **P0-adjacent** — all four MUST be killed at the ≥95% require-review bar. Security
  posture is unchanged (step 6a correctly denies a genuine `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` flag on a `["create"]`
  marker via direction B); the v1.11 work only closes the quoted-`--summary` false-deny and corrects the
  reasoning.
  **[EXTENDED v1.12 — ESCAPED-QUOTE differential-vs-bash partition (O5), ADV-F2-P9-001 MAJOR / D-DEC-001 v1.12.]**
  The adversary (P9-001) showed the P8-002 quote-aware tokenizer was STILL incomplete: it toggles
  UNQUOTED/IN_SINGLE/IN_DOUBLE on EVERY `"`/`'` regardless of a preceding backslash, so it diverges from bash for
  the backslash-escape class. For the Iron-Law-compliant command `jr issue create --project PRISMDEMO --summary
  "a\"b" --label REVIEW-REQUIRED`, bash/jr parse the args as `[--summary, a"b, --label, REVIEW-REQUIRED]` and
  apply a FUNCTIONAL REVIEW-REQUIRED label; the P8-002 tokenizer, however, treats the `\` as a literal char and
  the following `"` as a quote-CLOSE, then the next `"` as a quote-RE-OPEN — swallowing `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED`
  into the `--summary` token → `has_review_label=false`. Because P8-003 removed the step-5 backstop, a regular
  `["create"]` marker then wrongly AUTHORIZES a command that creates a REVIEW-REQUIRED-labeled ticket — the exact
  EC-023 direction-A fungibility bypass, with NO compensating control. The D-DEC-001 v1.12 fix makes the
  tokenizer backslash-aware (index-based iteration): `\"` in IN_DOUBLE → literal `"`, STAY IN_DOUBLE; `\'` in
  UNQUOTED → literal `'`, NO IN_SINGLE toggle — matching bash. Per the **O5 standing rule (§0)** this VP now
  carries the escaped-quote partition and is the **O5 compliance artifact** for `structural_label_check`: **1a**
  (SECURITY — escaped-quote boundary hides a real trailing `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` → `has_review_label=TRUE` →
  a `["create"]` marker is DENIED; kills **SM-43**), **1b** (false-deny prevention — escaped quote inside
  `--summary`, no real label → `has_review_label=FALSE` → ALLOW), and **partition-2** (UNQUOTED completeness —
  `\'` is a literal apostrophe with no IN_SINGLE state entered, so a subsequent whitespace-preceded `--label
  REVIEW-REQUIRED` is correctly detected → DENY). **SM-43** (revert the IN_DOUBLE backslash handling to the
  P8-002 toggle-on-every-quote) is separately killable from SM-40 (raw-substring) and SM-42 (split_on_whitespace)
  — neither of those mutations, nor the P8-002 quoted-form vector (which contains no `\"`), exercises the
  backslash-escape class, so vector 1a is the dedicated killer. **Equals-form `--label=REVIEW-REQUIRED` is SCOPED
  OUT of the partition** — jr CLI does not support the equals form (`jr issue create --help`, confirmed
  2026-07-21); only `--label VALUE` space-separated form is emitted. Per O5, re-evaluate if jr adds equals-form
  support. The step-6a mutant family is now **SM-36/37/40/42/43**, all P0-adjacent (step 6a is the SOLE
  anti-fungibility gate post-P8-003). **[EXTENDED v1.12 — STEP-3 dedup-before-fallback, ADV-F2-P9-007 MINOR.]**
  P9-007 observed that the P8-001 comment-review deny fallback hint ("if no review ticket exists, re-issue as
  create-review") assumes a null `ticket_id` means NO ticket exists — but a null `ticket_id` can be a
  dedup-lookup MISS while an open BLIND-SPOT/REVIEW-REQUIRED ticket exists, so blindly following the hint creates
  a DUPLICATE review ticket (violating D-DEC-004's one-open-ticket-per-(org,sensor)). The fix conditions the
  fallback on a §3.4 dedup re-run: VP-HOOK-029 gains a test-only vector (12) asserting the deny reason's fallback
  hint carries the dedup-re-run instruction (not a bare "try create-review"); the loop-side "dedup HIT → COMMENT,
  not a second create" behavior is discharged by **VP-SKILL-068** (grace-window + Jira-first dedup). No mutant is
  warranted (architect §8.21 item 2 — the change is in the deny-reason text, not a security-critical control-flow
  branch).
- **VP-SKILL-073 late-event drop detection (NEW v1.9, ADV-F2-P6-007 MINOR, D-DEC-002).** The D-DEC-002
  monotonic watermark WRITE guard (`max(stored, ts)`) means once the watermark advances past a late event's
  `_time`, that event is never re-queried — a SILENT missed-alert path on the HIGH-criticality watermark
  store. `DETECT_LATE_EVENT()` (Stage-1 INGEST, called after `NORMALIZE_PRISM_TIME`) converts it to an
  AUDITABLE one: when an ingested event's normalized `_time` is older than `watermark − WATERMARK_GRACE_SECONDS`,
  it appends a `LATE_EVENT_DETECTED` line (with `event_time=`, `watermark=`, `grace_window=`) to
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/watermarks/audit.log` and **processes the event normally** (never drops it). The
  BATS integration test injects a below-grace-floor event → asserts the audit line present AND the event
  reaches VALIDATE; control legs cover an in-window event (no detection) and first-run (no baseline → early
  return, no false positive). This gives operators the empirical signal to tune `WATERMARK_GRACE_SECONDS`
  during Wave-7 validation (ASM-008 is UNVALIDATED — prism `_time` format + ETL latency not yet known). No
  dedicated mutant beyond the D-DEC-002 watermark-guard family; the behavioral audit-entry assertion is the
  guard. Distinct from VP-SKILL-068 (in-grace dedup) and VP-SKILL-050 (monotonicity).
- **VP-SKILL-074 severity normalization correctness (NEW v1.9, ADV-F2-P6-005 MAJOR, D-DEC-013).** *(Namespace
  correction: architect §8.15 item 3 named this "VP-SKILL-072", which is OCCUPIED — first-run 24h lookback;
  allocated the next free VP-SKILL-074, see §1.)* prism normalizes the FOUR sensor families whose native
  severities are NOT the four-value enum (CrowdStrike numeric 1-100, Armis/Claroty risk bands, Cyberint
  conservative default pending ASM-008), and `disposition-guard`'s `validate_enums()` fail-closed-DENIES any non-member `verdict.severity`.
  **(P14-001 / P11-003: NVD/CVSS is NOT a NORMALIZE_SEVERITY family — `sensor_family` has no `nvd` member; NORMALIZE_SEVERITY
  is authoritative ONLY over sensor_family ∈ {crowdstrike, armis, claroty, cyberint}; a 0.0–10.0 CVSS float is enrichment that
  feeds `scored_priority` (field 18) at Stage 5, NOT `native_severity`.)**
  Without a named normalization step a raw sensor severity (`"Medium"` wrong-case, `"70"`, `"9.1"`) would
  either be denied (pipeline-unreachable for that sensor family) or, via the "defaults to CRITICAL" rule,
  mass-escalate. `NORMALIZE_SEVERITY(native, family)` (D-DEC-013, a NAMED Stage-1 pre-processing step,
  re-applied at Stage-5 SCORE and on the Stage-1 known-FP fast-path) maps every native value to
  `{LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL}` (case-exact, so `validate_enums()` never fails a well-normalized verdict); an
  UNRECOGNIZED value (any family, incl. Cyberint COMPUTE-AT-VALIDATION per ASM-008) → `CRITICAL` WITH
  `uncertainty_explicit` appended — an AUDITABLE conservative default, NEVER a silent enum-deny and NEVER a
  silent LOW. The VP is a BATS boundary/equivalence-partition test: CrowdStrike boundaries 26/51/76,
  Armis/Claroty risk-band case-fold (Critical→CRITICAL, Informational→LOW), the Cyberint conservative-default partition,
  and the unrecognized→CRITICAL
  +`uncertainty_explicit` auditable leg; it also asserts no raw sensor-native string ever reaches
  `validate_enums()`. No dedicated mutant (the `validate_enums()` fail-closed SM-31 is the downstream backstop
  if normalization regresses).
  **[EXTENDED v1.10 — Cyberint partition, ADV-F2-P7-006 MINOR / D-DEC-013 explicit conservative default.]**
  The adversary flagged that Cyberint is a RECOGNIZED family (org-b DTU demo, brief §4.2) whose per-band
  mapping is COMPUTE-AT-VALIDATION pending ASM-008, so the "unrecognized → CRITICAL" fallback did not
  cleanly fire and no concrete value was specified — a Cyberint alert could emit a non-enum placeholder that
  `validate_enums()` fail-closed-DENIES (that alert produces no verdict, no ticket) or an arbitrary tier
  (unsound hard-floor evaluation). D-DEC-013's Cyberint row is updated from the ambiguous
  COMPUTE-AT-VALIDATION to an EXPLICIT conservative default (mirrors the unrecognized-family rule, named):
  Cyberint → `CRITICAL` + `uncertainty_explicit` from first contact. Three strict partitions: (i) any
  Cyberint native severity → CRITICAL; (ii) Cyberint NEVER normalizes to LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH pre-ASM-008 (no
  down-tiering of an unvalidated family); (iii) the CRITICAL output carries `uncertainty_explicit` naming the
  unvalidated mapping. **These are pre-ASM-008 invariants — UPDATE WHEN ASM-008 RESOLVES: once the validated
  Cyberint per-band mapping lands, partitions (i)/(ii) are replaced by the real band boundaries (as with the
  other four families).** No dedicated mutant beyond SM-31 (the `validate_enums()` fail-closed backstop).
- **VP-SKILL-072 first-run 24h lookback correctness (NEW v1.5, ADV-F2-P4-012 / BC-10.01.001 Inv#13 /
  EC-001).** Dedicated VP for the absent-watermark bound that VP-SKILL-050 (monotonicity on an existing
  watermark) only mentioned incidentally. A loop-stub run against an EMPTY watermark dir must emit a
  PrismQL query bounded to `now() - INTERVAL 24 HOURS` (never a full-history scan) and persist a watermark
  at the latest processed `_time` after the run; control leg confirms an existing watermark does NOT take
  the 24h branch. No dedicated mutant (covered by the D-DEC-002 watermark-guard mutant family and the
  behavioral first-run assertion). Note: BC-10.01.001 Inv#15 (Resolved→propose-only, does NOT auto-reopen)
  is NOT given a new VP — it is already covered by **VP-SKILL-066** (update-jira never-auto-reopen,
  BC-4.02.001) on the analyst path and VP-SKILL-062 on the monitoring-loop path; §7 Part E records the
  cross-reference so Inv#15 is not left VP-orphaned.
- **VP-HOOK-030 DOWNGRADED to a consistency VP (v1.14, ADV-F2-P11-001 CRITICAL).** The pass-10 VP asserted STEP 1a
  made the severity floor "un-bypassable" by having the hook "independently derive severity from raw sensor values."
  The adversary (P11-001) proved this FALSE: `native_severity` (field 16) and `sensor_family` (field 17) are BOTH
  written by the monitoring-loop LLM at Stage-1 INGEST and read verbatim; the network-free hook makes no prism call,
  so STEP 1a re-computes the invariant from LLM-supplied inputs — a CONSISTENCY CHECK between two LLM fields, not
  ground-truth. An adversarial LLM can supply a false `native_severity`+`sensor_family`+`severity` triple that passes
  STEP 1a. The asserted guarantee is corrected to **"verdict.severity is consistent with verdict.native_severity per
  the D-DEC-013 table."** The SEVERITY-MISMATCH deny vectors are RETAINED (they still verify the consistency check, and
  still kill SM-44), but the guarantee they prove is downgraded. Genuine severity ground-truth is **ASM-008-DEFERRED,
  SYMMETRIC with the asset_type residual** (a prism-signed severity field or hook-fetched prism data). This is a pure
  wording/scope correction — no vector removed except the pass-10 CVSS-float under-report vector (removed per P11-003;
  see below). VP-HOOK-030 stays FINALIZED P0 as a consistency VP.
- **VP-HOOK-026 scored_priority high-severity floor (v1.14, ADV-F2-P11-002 MAJOR).** The pass-10 floor keyed the
  HIGH/CRITICAL leg on the hook-recomputed severity (STEP 1a output). P11-002 showed this is BOTH incompatible with
  the brief's Stage-5 recalibration (a recalibrated-DOWN verdict would false-deny) AND blind to KEV/exposure
  escalations (a detector-LOW alert scored CRIT by assess-priority would escape the floor). The floor now keys on
  `verdict.scored_priority` (field 18, the Stage-5 assess-priority output ∈{CRIT,HIGH,MED,LOW}) per brief §3.9 "any
  alert scored HIGH/CRIT → human." VP-HOOK-026 gains scored_priority floor legs — including the **detector-LOW /
  scored-CRIT** escalation (`verdict.severity=LOW` + consistent `native_severity` so STEP 1a passes, + `scored_priority=CRIT`
  → the floor STILL fires). Paired mutant **SM-46** (re-key the floor back to recomputed severity) is killed by that
  vector: under SM-46 the recomputed LOW → floor FALSE → a regular marker is wrongly issued for a CRIT-scored alert.
  A field-18 presence/enum validation leg is added to VP-HOOK-025 (absent/non-member `scored_priority` → deny).
  `scored_priority` is LLM-supplied (assess-priority is an LLM skill) — the SAME ASM-008-class residual as
  `native_severity` and `asset_type`; it is NOT asserted as ground-truth (§0 O6).
- **VP-HOOK-031 separate human-comment marker path (NEW v1.14, ADV-F2-P11-004 MAJOR).** P11-004 surfaced a
  BC-vs-architecture contradiction sharpened into an impossibility by P10-001: the specs disagreed on whether the
  12-field investigation-markdown path entered the verdict emitter, and the pass-10 emitter's `validate_enums()` (which
  requires verdict-only fields `severity`/`asset_type`/`ticket_action_type`/`native_severity`/`sensor_family`/`scored_priority`,
  none present in a 12-field markdown) would DENY a complete investigation at save time — the analyst could not save.
  The authoritative model (architecture-delta §D-DEC-008 "Separate Human-Comment Marker Path"): the investigation-markdown
  path does NOT enter the verdict emitter; it runs a separate, minimal comment-scoped marker path gated ONLY on (a)
  12-field completeness (heading-anchored grep) + (b) the markdown-evaluable hard floors (`Disposition: Indeterminate`,
  forbidden technique ∈{T1003,T1068,T1021,T1041}, `Sensor Health Status: degraded|silent`) — NOT `validate_enums()`/STEP 1a.
  VP-HOOK-031 asserts: (a) a compliant 12-field investigation save → a `["comment"]` marker bound to the parsed `ticket_id`
  is emitted and the Write is NOT denied; (b) a markdown-evaluable floor → `MARKDOWN-HARD-FLOOR` deny; (c) a 12-field
  markdown is NOT subjected to `validate_enums()`/STEP 1a (no false enum/SEVERITY-MISMATCH deny for absent verdict-only
  fields, incl. `scored_priority`). Paired mutant **SM-47** (route the 12-field markdown INTO the verdict emitter) is
  killed by (c)/(a): under SM-47 a compliant investigation hits `validate_enums()` and is wrongly denied on the absent
  verdict-only fields. It is on the disposition-guard hook (an ALLOW/DENY + marker decision), so it lives in VP-HOOK
  (sibling to VP-HOOK-025/026/030), NOT a VP-SKILL. Consumed by BC-5.01.001 (investigate-event) + BC-4.02.001 (human comment).
  **UPDATE v1.15 (ADV-F2-P12-002 CRITICAL):** the path was redesigned into four guarantees (kill switch first; non-FP→route-to-review; FP→comment marker; ticket_id charset). **UPDATE v1.16 (ADV-F2-P13-001 CRITICAL, human decision 2026-07-22 / architecture-delta §8.29):** **MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH is ELIMINATED — the markdown path issues NO autonomous `["comment"]` marker for ANY disposition.** Rationale: the hook cannot evaluate `scored_priority` (field 18) or `asset_type` (field 14) from a 12-field markdown, and there is no known-FP store cross-check on this path, so a comment marker cannot be floor-enforced (P12-002's GATE 1 closed the TP/BTP masquerade but left a residual FP-branch that granted an unfloored autonomous comment — the exact defect ADV-F2-P13-001 flagged). Guarantee (c) is REWRITTEN: after the markdown-evaluable floors pass, `Disposition: FP` → **allow-without-marker** (Write NOT denied; no Jira action; no comment marker — the analyst surfaces an FP comment via the review path or the 18-field verdict flow, preserving P11-004 intent); non-FP (TP/BTP) / PARSE_FAIL → **create-review/comment-review review marker** (EXEMPT from the kill switch). The prior FP→comment-marker vector is RETIRED (history preserved). Paired mutant **SM-52** (revert the elimination — FP markdown issues a comment marker) killed by the FP→allow-without-marker vector; **SM-50/SM-51 remain valid** (kill-switch gate / non-FP→review routing branches; killer vectors shifted under P13-001). **P13-003 MAJOR — strict parse grammar:** `parse_disposition_from_markdown` reads ONLY the canonical `Disposition` heading value against the {TP,FP,BTP,Indeterminate}+long-form allowlist (PARSE_FAIL→review on ambiguous/negated/multi-valued/empty/embedded-in-code-fence; NEVER allow-without-marker); `parse_autonomy_enabled_from_markdown` reads ONLY a dedicated structured field (a token inside a code fence/evidence block → false). Adversarial vectors: negated-FP prose→review; `Disposition: FP` inside a code fence (no canonical heading)→PARSE_FAIL→review; `autonomy_enabled: true` in an evidence block→gate CLOSED→allow-without-marker. Paired mutant **SM-53** (disposition parse uses a full-document substring scan → embedded/negated FP read as FP → allow-without-marker instead of review) killed by the FP-in-code-fence / negated-FP vectors.
- **NVD/CVSS clean separation (v1.14, ADV-F2-P11-003 MAJOR).** The pass-10 VP-HOOK-030 vector (5) treated a CVSS float
  as a hook-checked `native_severity` source and applied a per-family NORMALIZE_SEVERITY band to it — but `sensor_family`
  has no `nvd` member, so the per-family table is the wrong table for a 0.0–10.0 CVSS value. Per the clean separation,
  `native_severity`+`sensor_family` always describe the ORIGINATING SENSOR's raw reading; NVD/CVSS enrichment
  (`enrich_nvd()`) influences `scored_priority` (Stage-5), NOT `native_severity`. The CVSS-float STEP-1a vector is
  therefore REMOVED (no verification-delta vector now references NVD/CVSS as a `native_severity` source); CVSS's effect
  is exercised via the `scored_priority` floor (VP-HOOK-026) instead.

## 7. BC Corrections Required (product-owner owns the BCs — I do NOT edit them)

These are reference-hygiene corrections surfaced by adjudication. None changes a property; all
are qualifier/stale-text/VP-reference cleanups. Listed for the product-owner to apply in the BC
files (I do NOT edit BCs — PO owns them).

**A. Prior v1.0 corrections — CONFIRMED APPLIED (no further action).** Re-verified against the
LIVE BCs at edit time:
- VP-HOOK-024 `(PROPOSED)` qualifier dropped in **BC-3.01.001 v1.12/v1.13** (FV-PROPOSED-DROP).
- VP-HOOK-025 stale "F1 draft listed only 8 fields" meta-instruction removed and dual-path
  mechanism reference added in **BC-3.03.001 v1.7/v1.8** and **BC-10.01.001 v1.1/v1.2**.
- VP-SKILL-051..063 `(PROPOSED)` qualifiers dropped across BC-6.01.001/6.01.003/6.01.004/
  8.02.001/9.01.001/10.01.001 (v1.1/v1.2 FV-PROPOSED-DROP).
- tuning_signal three-way "absent=always-invalid" leg made explicit in **BC-3.03.001 v1.7 PC#4**
  (Step 1 unconditional `has()` check) — SM-18 preempted.
- ADV-F2-007 marker "in conversation context or JIRA comments" wording removed from
  **BC-4.02.001 v1.5** Precondition #1 / EC-001 (out-of-band `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/markers/` now
  the sole source).

**B. Prior v1.1 corrections (VP-SKILL-064/065) — CONFIRMED APPLIED (ADV-F2-P2-005; no further
action; superseding the stale "still-owed" framing).** The four VP-SKILL-064/065 corrections
requested by v1.1 are now live in **BC-10.01.001 v1.3/v1.4** — re-verified this edit. The earlier
"pending / still-owed" language (and the circular BC-cites-§7-while-§7-says-owed loop the adversary
flagged in ADV-F2-P2-005) is **removed**; both VPs are **FINALIZED**:
- Invariant #1: `(PROPOSED — pending formal-verifier finalization)` qualifier DROPPED for
  VP-SKILL-064 (BC-10.01.001 v1.3 revision note; line ~139 "FINALIZED v1.3").
- Invariant #11: VP-SKILL-065 cross-reference ADDED (BC-10.01.001 v1.3; line ~268).
- Verification Properties table: VP-SKILL-064 + VP-SKILL-065 rows ADDED (BC-10.01.001 v1.3;
  lines ~376–377).
- VP Anchors footer: both VPs listed as FINALIZED (BC-10.01.001 v1.3; line ~390).
- Audit-log path (ADV-F2-P2-007) + iterative-consume (ADV-F2-P2-003): BC-3.01.001 **v1.14**
  aligned Invariant #2 / PC#2 to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/markers/audit.log` and replaced the
  fail-fast consumer with iterative-consume — matching this delta's VP-HOOK-024 (§2). No further
  BC action.

**C. NEW corrections required by this v1.2 (VP-HOOK-027 + VP-SKILL-066/067/068 finalization).**
These are the only outstanding BC reference-hygiene items after pass 2. None alters a property.

1. **BC-10.01.001 Invariant #14 + Verification Properties table + VP Anchors footer
   (VP-HOOK-027 — stage-order document-before-action):** Invariant #14 (v1.4 corrected the
   Stage 7 DOCUMENT → Stage 8 TICKET ACTION ordering) carries the ordering fix but has **no VP
   cross-reference**. Add **VP-HOOK-027** (P1 cross-hook: a Stage-8 `jr` write is denied unless a
   Stage-7 verdict Write emitted a matching marker within TTL) to Invariant #14, add a row to the
   Verification Properties table, and append it to the VP Anchors footer. Strategy per §2
   (B-INT-XH: negative jr-before-Write→deny, positive correct-order→allow, TTL-expiry→deny).
2. **BC-4.02.001 Verification Properties table + Invariants #4/#5 (VP-SKILL-066/067):** the VP
   table currently lists only VP-SKILL-006/007/008 (line ~105) and Invariants #4 (never-auto-reopen)
   and #5 (SLA surface) have **no VP cross-reference**. Add **VP-SKILL-066** (Inv#4 never-auto-reopen
   on the update-jira path — the §Refactoring-Notes formal-verification target: no code path from
   PC#7c/PC#7d emits `jr issue move`) and **VP-SKILL-067** (Inv#5 SLA surface — append/link/
   propose-reopen emit an explicit SLA-impact statement) as VP-table rows and as the invariants'
   VP anchors.
3. **BC-10.01.001 Invariant #8 (dedup) / D-DEC-002 reference (VP-SKILL-068):** the dedup /
   grace-window invariant carries the D-DEC-002 grace-window + Jira-first dedup design but has no
   VP guarding it (VP-SKILL-050 is watermark-monotonicity only). Add **VP-SKILL-068** (in-grace
   re-fetched event with an existing open ticket → COMMENT not create) as the Invariant #8 / dedup
   VP anchor and a Verification Properties table row.
4. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md (formal-verifier/PO registration):** register
   VP-HOOK-027, VP-SKILL-066, VP-SKILL-067, VP-SKILL-068 as FINALIZED (they occupy the
   previously-free 027 / 066 / 067 / 068 slots; VP-HOOK is now 024–027, VP-SKILL 001–068). No
   renumbering of any existing VP.

**D. NEW corrections required by this v1.3 (pass-3 VP finalization: VP-SKILL-069/070/071 +
VP-HOOK-028).** None alters a property; all are VP-cross-reference / status finalizations.

1. **BC-5.01.001 Invariant #8 + Verification Properties table (VP-SKILL-069):** BC-5.01.001 v1.8
   already lists VP-SKILL-069 as `PROPOSED — formal-verifier finalizes scope and BATS fixture`
   (Inv#8 + VP table row). **Drop the `PROPOSED` qualifier → FINALIZED** and confirm the strategy
   as authored (static Iron-Law WHERE-clause assertion on the Stage-3 OCSF + temporal-adjacency
   PrismQL blocks + prism-DTU multi-org org-a-returns-zero-org-b/c fixture + unscoped-query
   adversarial leg). Scope confirmed exactly as the BC states — no scope change.
2. **BC-4.05.001 Invariant #4 + PC#6 + Verification Properties table (VP-SKILL-070, VP-SKILL-071):**
   BC-4.05.001 v1.3 already lists VP-SKILL-070 as `PROPOSED` (Inv#4 org_slug + VP table row).
   **Drop the `PROPOSED` qualifier → FINALIZED** (strategy confirmed: static PC#5a/5b/5d WHERE-clause
   assertion + DTU multi-org fixture + unscoped-query leg). **Additionally add VP-SKILL-071** (PC#6 /
   D-DEC-011 confidence float→enum consistency — boundary test at 0.75/0.40) as a NEW Verification
   Properties table row and as the PC#6 VP anchor (BC-4.05.001 currently has no VP cross-reference for
   the float→enum mapping guarantee).
3. **BC-10.01.001 Stage-7 PC#8 + Invariant #9 field#2 + Invariant #10 (VP-HOOK-028, VP-HOOK-026
   unknown leg, D-DEC-011):** (a) add **VP-HOOK-028** (verdict-path reachability) as the PC#8
   verdict-file-path-naming-convention VP anchor + a Verification Properties table row; (b) confirm
   **VP-HOOK-026** now cross-references the `asset_type=unknown` hard-floor member in Invariant #10
   (BC-10.01.001 v1.9 Inv#10 already includes `unknown`; the VP anchor should name the unknown leg
   explicitly); (c) Invariant #9 field#2 confidence-is-enum-only note should cross-reference
   **VP-HOOK-025** (already the field-completeness VP) for the float-reject assertion.
4. **BC-3.03.001 Invariant #4 hard-floor list + PC#2/PC#3 (VP-HOOK-026 unknown leg, VP-HOOK-025
   per-class split):** (a) Invariant #4 hard-floor list — once BC-3.03.001 v1.13 adds the
   `asset_type=='unknown'` bullet (architecture-delta §8.8.1 item 1), the **VP-HOOK-026** anchor
   should name the unknown leg; (b) PC#2 (investigation markdown = 12 fields) and PC#3 (verdict JSON =
   15 fields) are the per-class field-set surfaces for **VP-HOOK-025** — confirm both PCs cite
   VP-HOOK-025 with the 12-vs-15 split made explicit (architecture-delta §8.8.1 item 3 corrects the
   PC#2 15→12 erratum).
5. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md (formal-verifier/PO registration):** register
   **VP-SKILL-069, VP-SKILL-070, VP-SKILL-071, VP-HOOK-028** as FINALIZED (they occupy the
   previously-free 069 / 070 / 071 / 028 slots — 069/070 already PROPOSED-referenced in BC-5.01.001 /
   BC-4.05.001; VP-SKILL is now 001–071, VP-HOOK 024–028). Update the **VP-HOOK-025** and
   **VP-HOOK-026** entries for the per-class split and unknown-asset leg. No renumbering of any
   existing VP.

**E. NEW corrections required by this v1.5 (pass-4: VP-HOOK-029 + VP-SKILL-072 + VP-HOOK-024/025/026/028
extensions).** None alters a property; all are VP-cross-reference / status additions on the pass-4
BCs (BC-3.03.001 v1.13, BC-3.01.001 v1.17, BC-10.01.001 v1.9, BC-4.02.001 v1.8, BC-6.01.001 v1.5).
These are the outstanding BC VP-anchor additions the PO must apply — I do NOT edit the BCs.

1. **BC-10.01.001 — VP-HOOK-029 (fail-loud, P1) + VP-SKILL-072 (first-run 24h lookback) + Inv#15
   cross-ref.** (a) Add **VP-HOOK-029** as the VP anchor for the narrowed Invariant #10 / D-DEC-012
   fail-loud guarantee (hard-floor verdict → `create-review`/`comment-review` marker OR explicit error,
   never silent discard) + a Verification Properties table row. Architect §8.11 item 6 tags it **P1**
   and requests **PROPOSED** lifecycle status (F6-adjudicated) — register accordingly. (b) Add
   **VP-SKILL-072** as the VP anchor for **Invariant #13** (first-run 24h lookback) / EC-001 + a VP-table
   row (currently Inv#13 has no VP cross-reference; VP-SKILL-050 covers monotonicity only). (c)
   **Invariant #15** (Resolved→propose-only) needs no new VP — add an explicit cross-reference that it is
   covered by **VP-SKILL-066** (update-jira never-auto-reopen, BC-4.02.001) and VP-SKILL-062
   (monitoring-loop path), so Inv#15 is not left VP-orphaned. (d) Confirm **VP-HOOK-028** now cites the
   Stage-7 PC#8 JSON-first dispatch (not merely `verdict`-substring reachability). (e) Confirm Invariant
   #9 now lists `autonomy_enabled` among the non-ICD-203 operational metadata fields with a **VP-HOOK-026**
   determinism cross-reference.
2. **BC-3.03.001 v1.13 — PC#1/2/3 JSON-first dispatch + validate_enums + review-surfacing.** (a) PC#1/2/3
   (rewritten to JSON-first per architecture-delta v1.6 §A) are the VP-HOOK-028 dispatch surface — cite
   **VP-HOOK-028** on the dispatch precedence (JSON/`.json` → verdict-class regardless of `investigation`
   substring). (b) Invariant #4 / PC#3 emitter — cite **VP-HOOK-025** for the `validate_enums()`
   membership gate (fail-closed DENY on non-member severity/asset_type/disposition/sensor_health_status/
   ticket_action_type/confidence, BEFORE hard floor). (c) The D-DEC-012 review-surfacing emitter branch
   (create-review/comment-review markers, hard-floor + kill-switch EXEMPT) and the `autonomy_enabled`
   read-direct-from-verdict Step 4 — cite **VP-HOOK-026** (and **VP-HOOK-029** for the fail-loud emit).
3. **BC-3.01.001 v1.17 — consumer create-pattern + audit sanitization + review-token acceptance.** (a)
   Consumer step (5) anchored create `command_pattern` (`--project` first, `( |$)` trailing) — cite
   **VP-HOOK-024** for the injection-safety guarantee (--summary injection + PROD/PRODUCTION prefix →
   DENY). (b) Consumer step (8) audit control-char stripping (`ticket_id`/`org_slug`/`op`) — cite
   **VP-HOOK-024** (audit-forgery leg). (c) Consumer step (6) acceptance of `create-review`/
   `comment-review` `authorized_operations` tokens — cite **VP-HOOK-029** (the fail-loud escalation
   consumer path).
4. **BC-4.02.001 v1.8 — PC#4 cross-tenant stale removal (P4-008) + Inv#15 cross-ref confirm.** (a)
   Confirm the P4-008 removal of "cross-tenant campaign correlation findings" from the PC#4 hard-floor
   enumeration (align with BC-3.03.001/BC-3.01.001 post-P3-011). (b) Confirm **VP-SKILL-066** remains the
   anchor for the Resolved→propose-only never-auto-reopen guarantee that BC-10.01.001 Inv#15 cross-refs.
   (No new VP.)
5. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md (formal-verifier/PO registration):** register
   **VP-SKILL-072** as FINALIZED and **VP-HOOK-029** as **PROPOSED** (P1, F6-adjudicated per architect
   §8.11 item 6) in the previously-free 072 / 029 slots. Update the **VP-HOOK-024/025/026/028** entries
   for the pass-4 extensions (injection-safety, validate_enums, review-surfacing + kill-switch, JSON-first
   dispatch). VP-SKILL is now 001–072, VP-HOOK 024–029. No renumbering of any existing VP.

**F. NEW corrections required by this v1.8 (pass-5 re-scope: VP-HOOK-029 + VP-HOOK-026 + SM-32a/32b).**
*(HISTORICAL — the STEP numbering below is the v1.8-era layout; the ADV-F2-P6-002 STEP REORDER at v1.9
renumbers the under-label upgrade from STEP 5 → **STEP 4** (now before the STEP 5 kill switch). See Part G
for the current, superseding v1.9 numbering.)*
The disposition-guard STEP 3 (over-label gate) and STEP 5 (under-label fail-loud upgrade — **renumbered to
STEP 4 at v1.9**) emitter BODY updates are owned by the product-owner per architecture-delta v1.8 §8.12
(BC-3.03.001 STEP 3+STEP 5; BC-10.01.001 Inv#10 ticket_action_type under-label semantics) — I do NOT edit
the BCs. The FV-side cross-references the PO should reflect when applying those STEP updates:
1. **BC-3.03.001 v1.13 Inv#4 emitter — STEP 3 over-label gate + STEP 5 under-label upgrade.** (a) The
   STEP 3 review-marker exemption gated on `hard_floor_applies(verdict)=TRUE` (over-labeled non-hard-floor
   verdict with a review token → allow-without-marker) — cite **VP-HOOK-026** (over-label legs, SM-32b).
   (b) The STEP 5 deterministic upgrade of an under-labeled hard-floor verdict to create-review/comment-review
   (or error-artifact+deny when no `jira_project_key`) with an UNDER-LABEL-CORRECTED audit entry — cite
   **VP-HOOK-029** (under-label fail-loud vectors, SM-32a).
2. **BC-10.01.001 v1.9 Inv#10 — narrowed under-label semantics.** Inv#10 (hard floor → create-review/
   comment-review, and STEP 5 fail-loud-upgrades under-labeled hard-floor verdicts, never silent `none`)
   — confirm **VP-HOOK-029** remains its anchor (the fail-loud guarantee) and **VP-HOOK-026** the
   over-label gate. No new VP; no renumbering.
3. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md:** re-scope the **VP-HOOK-029** entry from the pass-4
   happy-path scope to the under-label fail-loud scope (fix-priority P0), and add the **VP-HOOK-026**
   over-label legs. Record **SM-32** as split into **SM-32a** (under-label, VP-HOOK-029) and **SM-32b**
   (over-label, VP-HOOK-026). VP namespace UNCHANGED (VP-SKILL 001–072, VP-HOOK 024–029).

**G. Corrections required by v1.9 (pass-6: VP-HOOK-029 FINALIZE + kill-switch-on vectors,
consumer STEP 6a, VP-SKILL-065 re-scope, VP-SKILL-073 late-event, VP-SKILL-074 severity normalization,
SM-32-ext / SM-36 / SM-37).** *(PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED — the STEP-4 marker-UPGRADE mechanism below is RETIRED
at v1.10; ADV-F2-P7-001 replaces it with STEP-4 DENY-THE-WRITE. The consumer STEP 6a, VP-SKILL-065 carve-out,
VP-SKILL-073, VP-SKILL-074, and SM-36/SM-37 corrections REMAIN VALID. See Part H for the superseding v1.10
deny-the-Write cross-references and the VP-HOOK-029 end-to-end re-scope.)* The BODY updates — the
disposition-guard STEP REORDER (STEP 4 under-label upgrade before STEP 5 kill switch), the consumer STEP 6a anti-fungibility cross-check + the create-review
`command_pattern` `--label` addition, the Inv#11 Option-A carve-out, the D-DEC-013 severity-normalization
step, and the D-DEC-002 late-event detection — are owned by the product-owner per architecture-delta v1.9
§8.14 (BC-3.03.001 STEP reorder + pattern; BC-3.01.001 consumer STEP 6a; BC-10.01.001 Inv#11 carve-out +
VP-SKILL-065 re-scope + severity normalization + late-event). I do NOT edit the BCs. FV-side
cross-references the PO should reflect (live-BC targets: **BC-3.01.001 v1.18, BC-3.03.001 v1.15,
BC-10.01.001 v1.11**):
1. **BC-3.03.001 v1.15 Inv#4 emitter — STEP REORDER + STEP 4 upgrade + create-review pattern.** (a) The
   STEP 4 under-label upgrade now runs BEFORE the STEP 5 `autonomy_enabled` kill switch (ADV-F2-P6-002) —
   cite **VP-HOOK-029** (under-label fail-loud + kill-switch-ON under-label vectors, SM-32a + SM-32-ext).
   (b) The create-review `command_pattern` now carries `--label (REVIEW-REQUIRED|BLIND-SPOT)` in fixed
   second position after `--project <key>` — cite **VP-HOOK-024** (consumer STEP 6a anti-fungibility).
2. **BC-3.01.001 v1.18 — consumer STEP 6a anti-fungibility (P6-001 / EC-023).** Cite **VP-HOOK-024** for
   the both-direction cross-check (create-review marker refused for a no-`--label` command; create marker
   refused for a `--label` command; correct pairings consume) and the create-review pattern `--label` add.
3. **BC-10.01.001 v1.11 — Inv#10/11 + Stage-1.** (a) Inv#10 STEP 4 fail-loud (reordered before the kill
   switch) — confirm **VP-HOOK-029** FINALIZED (was PROPOSED) is its anchor. (b) Inv#11 Option-A carve-out
   ("under `autonomy_enabled=false`, zero REGULAR markers/writes; create-review/comment-review escalation
   writes for genuine hard-floor verdicts still execute") — cite **VP-SKILL-065** (RE-SCOPED, PROPOSED).
   (c) Stage-1 severity normalization (field 13, D-DEC-013) — add **VP-SKILL-074** as VP anchor + VP-table
   row (namespace-corrected from the architect's "VP-SKILL-072"). (d) Stage-1 late-event fail-loud
   (D-DEC-002 `DETECT_LATE_EVENT`) — add **VP-SKILL-073** as VP anchor + VP-table row.
4. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md:** (a) **FINALIZE VP-HOOK-029** (PROPOSED → FINALIZED,
   P0) with the kill-switch-on under-label vectors. (b) **RE-SCOPE VP-SKILL-065** (FINALIZED → PROPOSED,
   Option-A carve-out). (c) register **VP-SKILL-073** (P1, PROPOSED, next-free 073) and **VP-SKILL-074**
   (P1, PROPOSED, next-free 074 — NOT 072, which is occupied). (d) add mutants **SM-32-ext** (under the
   SM-32 family), **SM-36**, **SM-37** (NOT SM-33/SM-34, which are occupied pass-4 sentinels). VP namespace
   now VP-SKILL 001–074, VP-HOOK 024–029; SM 9–37. No renumbering of any existing VP or SM.

**H. NEW corrections required by this v1.10 (pass-7: STEP-4 DENY-THE-WRITE redesign + VP-HOOK-029 end-to-end
re-scope + step-6a structural fix + Cyberint mapping + O4 standing rule; SM-38 / SM-39 / SM-40).** The BODY
updates — the disposition-guard STEP-4 DENY-THE-WRITE (marker-upgrade RETIRED), the consumer step-6a
`structural_label_check`, the D-DEC-013 explicit Cyberint conservative default, and the six stale
"no marker for hard floor" locations (EC-015/016/017/021 + two canonical test vectors — P7-002) — are owned
by the product-owner per architecture-delta v1.10 §8.16. I do NOT edit the BCs. FV-side cross-references the
PO should reflect (live-BC targets: **BC-3.01.001 v1.19, BC-3.03.001 v1.16, BC-10.01.001 v1.12**):
1. **BC-3.03.001 v1.16 Inv#4 emitter — STEP 4 DENY-THE-WRITE (upgrade RETIRED).** (a) The under-labeled
   hard-floor verdict is now DENIED at STEP 4 with a structured corrective reason (`hard_floor_trigger`,
   `required_token`, `label_instruction`, `instruction`) + an `UNDER-LABEL-DENIED` audit entry (NO marker;
   `UNDER-LABEL-CORRECTED` RETIRED) — cite **VP-HOOK-029** (deny-path + machine-actionable-reason vectors;
   SM-38, SM-39, re-targeted SM-32a, SM-32-ext). STEP 4 remains before the STEP 5 kill switch.
2. **BC-3.01.001 v1.19 — consumer step-6a structural token check + review-token acceptance.** (a) Consumer
   step-6a `structural_label_check` (`--label` as a standalone token preceding REVIEW-REQUIRED/BLIND-SPOT,
   not a raw substring over the whole command) — cite **VP-HOOK-024** (false-deny-prevention vector; SM-40).
   (b) Consumer step (6) acceptance of `create-review`/`comment-review` tokens is the CONSUMER-BOUNDARY
   surface for VP-HOOK-029's end-to-end assertion (the escalation jr write is authorized AND consumable) —
   cite **VP-HOOK-029** (consumer-boundary vectors).
3. **BC-10.01.001 v1.12 — Inv#10 + Stage-1 + six stale locations.** (a) Inv#10 STEP-4 DENY-THE-WRITE
   (reordered before the kill switch) — confirm **VP-HOOK-029** (re-scoped end-to-end, re-FINALIZED P0) is
   its anchor; the fail-loud guarantee is now the CONSUMER-BOUNDARY jr authorization/execution outcome per
   the O4 standing rule (§0), NOT an emitter-local marker. (b) The loop re-document obligation on a STEP-4
   deny (re-issue the Write with `required_token`) — VP-HOOK-029's corrected-rewrite happy-path vector is its
   verification. (c) The six pre-D-DEC-012 "no marker for hard floor" locations (EC-015/016/017/021 + two
   canonical test vectors, P7-002 CRITICAL) that a story-writer/FV could otherwise encode as the
   silent-discard bug — confirm they are updated to the post-D-DEC-012 semantics before any test authoring;
   VP-HOOK-029's negative assertion (a hard-floor verdict must NOT leave the marker dir empty with no
   deny/audit, and must NOT hold an unconsumable marker) is the guard. (d) Stage-1 field-13 Cyberint mapping
   (D-DEC-013 explicit CRITICAL + uncertainty_explicit) — cite **VP-SKILL-074** (Cyberint partition).
4. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md:** (a) **RE-SCOPE + re-FINALIZE VP-HOOK-029** (re-marked
   PROPOSED, then FINALIZED P0) to the end-to-end consumer-boundary deny-the-Write scope (O4); mark the three
   v1.9 upgrade-marker vectors + the UNDER-LABEL-CORRECTED audit assertion RETIRED (reason "mechanism removed
   ADV-F2-P7-001"). (b) update the **VP-HOOK-024** entry for the step-6a structural false-deny vector and the
   **VP-SKILL-074** entry for the Cyberint partition. (c) add mutants **SM-38** (step4-deny-removed), **SM-39**
   (deny-corrective-reason-removed), **SM-40** (has_review_label-raw-substring); record SM-32a RE-TARGETED and
   SM-32-ext kill vector RE-WORDED. (d) codify the **O4 standing rule** (§0). VP namespace UNCHANGED at
   VP-SKILL 001–074, VP-HOOK 024–029; SM now 9–40 (occupancy re-verified before allocation, Lesson 8). No
   renumbering of any existing VP or SM.

**I. NEW corrections required by this v1.11 (pass-8: STEP-3 `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` deny + quote-aware
tokenizer + EC-023 step-5 correction; SM-41 / SM-42).** The BODY updates — the disposition-guard STEP-3
DENY-THE-WRITE for missing binding fields, the consumer step-6a quote-aware `structural_label_check`, the
EC-023/EC-024 corrections, and the Cyberint operator notes — are owned by the product-owner per
architecture-delta v1.11 §8.18 (edited in parallel). I do NOT edit the BCs. FV-side cross-references the PO
should reflect (live-BC post-pass-8 (version-coherence sweep applied burst-4): **BC-3.01.001 v1.20, BC-3.03.001 v1.17, BC-10.01.001
v1.13**):
1. **BC-3.03.001 Inv#4 emitter — STEP 3 `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` DENY-THE-WRITE (P8-001 CRITICAL).** Both
   silent `emit allow without marker; RETURN` branches (create-review + null `jira_project_key`;
   comment-review + null `ticket_id`) are replaced with a deny + `HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` audit entry naming
   `missing_field`, per D-DEC-012 clause 2 (comment-review adds a create-review fallback hint when
   `jira_project_key` is present) — cite **VP-HOOK-029** (unbindable-deny vectors 9–11; SM-41). Bounded
   fail-closed non-termination (one audit entry + one deny per re-doc attempt, no Jira write).
2. **BC-3.01.001 consumer step-6a — quote-aware tokenizer (P8-002 MAJOR).** `structural_label_check` uses a
   state-machine tokenizer (UNQUOTED/IN_SINGLE/IN_DOUBLE), NOT `split_on_whitespace`; a `--label` literal
   inside a quoted `--summary` value is a single token → `has_review_label=false` → ALLOW. EC-024 reconciled
   to this mechanism — cite **VP-HOOK-024** (quoted-form false-deny vector; SM-42, separately killable from
   SM-40).
3. **BC-3.01.001 EC-023 direction A + create generation-table note — step-5 correction (P8-003 MINOR).** Bash
   `[[ =~ ]]` is NOT tail-anchored; the regular create pattern PASSES step 5 for a review-labeled create
   (`( |$)` guards only against project-KEY prefix extension). Anti-fungibility direction A is enforced
   EXCLUSIVELY at step-6a — cite **VP-HOOK-024** (SM-36/SM-37 both directions; the step-6a family is
   P0-adjacent/non-redundant). No verification-delta current-body assertion made the false step-5 claim; this
   is a BC/architecture-delta text correction.
4. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md:** (a) EXTEND (do NOT re-scope) the **VP-HOOK-029** entry
   with the P8-001 STEP-3 unbindable-deny vectors — it stays FINALIZED P0. (b) EXTEND the **VP-HOOK-024**
   entry — the step-6a false-deny vector is updated to the QUOTED form. (c) add mutants **SM-41**
   (step3-create-review-unbindable-allow-reverted) and **SM-42**
   (structural_label_check-non-quote-aware). (d) note the SM-36/37/40/42 step-6a family is P0-adjacent
   (sole anti-fungibility enforcement point). SM now 9–42 (occupancy re-verified before allocation, Lesson 8).
   No renumbering of any existing VP or SM.

**J. NEW corrections required by this v1.12 (pass-9: escaped-quote tokenizer partition + dedup-before-fallback
gate + O5 codification; SM-43).** The BODY updates — the disposition-guard/consumer STEP-6a backslash-aware
`structural_label_check`, the D-DEC-005 sensor-health carve-out, the STEP-3 comment-review dedup-before-fallback
obligation, the `jira_project_key` Stage-0 precondition + re-doc cap — are owned by the product-owner per
architecture-delta v1.12 §8.20 (edited in parallel). I do NOT edit the BCs. FV-side cross-references the PO
should reflect (post-pass-9 targets per architecture-delta §8.20 (version-coherence sweep applied burst-5): **BC-3.01.001 v1.21**, **BC-8.02.001 v1.3**,

1. **BC-3.01.001 consumer step-6a — backslash-aware tokenizer (P9-001 MAJOR).** `structural_label_check` must
   treat `\"` in IN_DOUBLE as a literal `"` (STAY IN_DOUBLE) and `\'` in UNQUOTED as a literal `'` (NO IN_SINGLE
   toggle), matching bash argument parsing (index-based iteration replaces the for-char loop). This closes the
   escaped-quote desync where a `\"` inside `--summary` prematurely closed the quoted region and swallowed a
   REAL trailing `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` (has_review_label=false → fungibility bypass). Cite **VP-HOOK-024**
   (escaped-quote partition 1a/1b/partition-2; SM-43, separately killable from SM-40/SM-42). Equals-form
   `--label=VALUE` SCOPED OUT (jr has no equals form, confirmed 2026-07-21).
2. **BC-10.01.001 STEP-3 comment-review fallback — dedup-before-create-review gate (P9-007 MINOR).** The
   comment-review + null-`ticket_id` + present-`jira_project_key` deny reason's fallback hint must instruct the
   loop to re-run the §3.4 BLIND-SPOT/REVIEW-REQUIRED dedup query for the (org_slug, sensor_id) BEFORE switching
   to `create-review` — a null `ticket_id` may be a dedup-lookup MISS, and a dedup HIT must produce a COMMENT on
   the existing ticket, NOT a duplicate `create-review` (D-DEC-004 one-open-ticket). Cite **VP-HOOK-029**
   (dedup-gate vector 12, test-only, no mutant) + **VP-SKILL-068** (loop-side dedup-HIT→comment behavior).
3. **BC-8.02.001 / BC-10.01.001 Inv#1 — D-DEC-005 sensor-health carve-out (P9-005 MINOR, PO-owned).** No FV VP
   change required — `prism_sensor_health` metadata queries are exempt from the raw-data org_slug isolation rule
   (VP-SKILL-064/069/070 continue to assert org_slug scope for raw per-tenant sensor-data queries only;
   sensor-metrics VP-SKILL-056 is unaffected). Recorded here for cross-reference completeness; no VP re-scope.
4. **BC-6.01.001 Stage-0 + BC-10.01.001 re-doc cap (P9-008 OBS, PO-owned).** No FV VP change this pass — the
   `jira_project_key` Stage-0 precondition and the max-3 HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE re-doc cap are loop/activate BODY
   obligations. When F6 sizes the cap, VP-HOOK-029's bounded-non-termination leg may be extended to assert the
   `HARD-FLOOR-LIVELOCK-ABORT` operator-facing artifact after the cap; flagged for F6, not allocated now.
5. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md:** (a) EXTEND (do NOT re-scope) the **VP-HOOK-024** entry with
   the P9-001 escaped-quote differential-vs-bash partition — it stays FINALIZED; mark it the O5 compliance
   artifact for `structural_label_check`. (b) EXTEND the **VP-HOOK-029** entry with the P9-007 dedup-gate
   test-only vector — it stays FINALIZED P0. (c) add mutant **SM-43** (step6a-in_double-backslash-escape-reverted).
   (d) note the step-6a family is now SM-36/37/40/42/43 (all P0-adjacent, sole anti-fungibility gate). SM now
   9–43 (occupancy re-verified before allocation, Lesson 8). No renumbering of any existing VP or SM. (e) codify

`MARKER-WRITE-FAILED` fail-closed branch, the cron-wrapper Gate 2, the D-DEC-005 carve-out predicate
tightening, ASM-015, and the D-DEC-012 O3-table O6 row — are owned by the product-owner/architect per
architecture-delta v1.13 §8.22/§8.23 (edited in parallel). I do NOT edit the BCs. FV-side cross-references the
PO should reflect (post-pass-10 targets, PO-owned; exact numbers reconciled by the dedicated version-coherence
sweep):
1. **BC-3.03.001 disposition-guard STEP 1 + STEP 1a (P10-001 CRITICAL).** (a) `validate_enums()` STEP 1 now
   also requires field 16 `native_severity` (non-empty string) and field 17 `sensor_family` (enum
   ∈{crowdstrike,armis,claroty,cyberint}) — cite **VP-HOOK-025** (fields-16/17 presence legs) and
   **VP-HOOK-030** (the STEP-1 inputs to STEP 1a). (b) STEP 1a re-runs `NORMALIZE_SEVERITY(native_severity,
   sensor_family)`; `recomputed_severity != verdict.severity` → `SEVERITY-MISMATCH` audit + deny;
   `hard_floor_applies()` keys on `recomputed_severity` — cite **VP-HOOK-030** (per-family under-report vectors;
   SM-44). This is the O6 compliance artifact (§0).
2. **BC-3.03.001 WRITE_MARKER review-path fail-closed (P10-003 MAJOR).** On the STEP-3 create-review/comment-review
   (hard-floor review) path, a `write_marker` failure → `MARKER-WRITE-FAILED` audit + deny (mirrors
   HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE, D-DEC-012 clause 2); the regular (comment/create/assign) path retains
   allow-without-marker — cite **VP-HOOK-029** (marker-write fail-closed vectors 13/14 + regular-path control 14a;
   SM-45). Bounded fail-closed; NEVER a silent hard-floor drop on the review path.
3. **BC-10.01.001 17-field verdict schema + Inv#9 + Inv#10 (P10-001).** Inv#9 field list is now **17 fields** (12
   ICD-203 + severity[13] + asset_type[14] + ticket_action_type[15] + native_severity[16] + sensor_family[17]);
   Inv#10 hard floor keys on the hook-recomputed severity (VP-HOOK-030), NOT raw `verdict.severity` — remove the
   "the LLM cannot bypass / definitive enforcement surface" language for LLM-supplied severity. asset_type
   cross-validation is ASM-008-DEFERRED (documented residual). Cite **VP-HOOK-025/030**.
4. **BC-10.01.001 Inv#1 + D-DEC-005 carve-out tightening (P10-006/P10-007 MINOR).** The `prism_sensor_health`
   org_slug exemption is scoped to the SOLE-table case (no JOIN/subquery/CTE against a raw per-tenant table) —
   cite **VP-SKILL-064** with the renamed/added @test names (`rejects unscoped RAW-TABLE PrismQL query`,
   `allows unscoped prism_sensor_health query (D-DEC-005 carve-out)`, `rejects prism_sensor_health JOIN raw-table
   query without org_slug (P10-006 boundary)`).
5. **BC-9.01.001 scan-threats org_slug — VP-SKILL-059 behavioral upgrade (P10-005 MINOR).** VP-SKILL-059 is
   upgraded from structural-only to behavioral (prism-DTU multi-org fixture: org-a hunt returns zero org-b/c rows)
   + a static assertion that every query in `data/threat-hunt-queries.md` carries an `org_slug` clause — cite
   **VP-SKILL-059** on the Iron Law + hunt-query-library invariant. SM-24 (org_slug-drop) is the paired kill target.
6. **run-monitoring-loop.sh + BC-10.01.001 PC#7 operator-boundary (P10-002 MAJOR).** The cron wrapper `exit 1`
   when `markers/audit.log` carries a fail-loud code (HARD-FLOOR-LIVELOCK-ABORT | HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE |
   UNDER-LABEL-DENIED | SEVERITY-MISMATCH | MARKER-WRITE-FAILED) newer than run-start; `exit 0` on a clean run —
   cite **VP-SKILL-075** (Gate-2 vectors). **ASM-015 (BLOCKING for the Gate-1 leg):** whether a PreToolUse-hook
   deny populates `.permission_denials` under `--allowedTools` is UNVALIDATED; VP-SKILL-075's Gate-1
   `.permission_denials` leg is ASM-015-PENDING and NOT counted toward convergence until ASM-015 resolves.
   Register ASM-015 as BLOCKING for the loop stories that rely on `permission_denials` for operator signaling.
7. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md (formal-verifier/PO registration):** register **VP-HOOK-030**
   (FINALIZED P0, next-free 030) and **VP-SKILL-075** (PROPOSED P1, next-free 075, Gate-1 leg ASM-015-BLOCKED);
   EXTEND **VP-HOOK-029** (P10-003 marker-write fail-closed vectors, +SM-45 — stays FINALIZED P0); UPGRADE
   **VP-SKILL-059** (structural→behavioral); update **VP-SKILL-064** (carve-out @test rename/adds) and **VP-HOOK-025**
   (fields 16/17). Add mutants **SM-44** (step1a-severity-renormalization-reverted) and **SM-45**

**L. NEW corrections required by this v1.14 (pass-11: STEP 1a consistency-only reframe + scored_priority field-18
two-field model + NVD/CVSS clean separation + separate human-comment marker path + O6 residual annotation;
VP-HOOK-031, SM-46/SM-47).** The BODY updates — STEP 1a re-framed as a consistency check, the `scored_priority`
(field 18) verdict schema extension, the `hard_floor_applies()` high-severity floor re-keyed to `scored_priority`,
the NVD/CVSS→scored_priority separation, and the separate human-comment (12-field investigation-markdown) marker
path — are owned by the product-owner/architect per architecture-delta v1.14 §8.24/§8.25 (edited in parallel). I do
NOT edit the BCs. FV-side cross-references the PO should reflect (post-pass-11 targets, PO-owned; exact numbers
reconciled by the dedicated version-coherence sweep):
1. **BC-3.03.001 disposition-guard STEP 1a — CONSISTENCY-ONLY reframe (P11-001 CRITICAL).** STEP 1a asserts
   `verdict.severity` is CONSISTENT with `verdict.native_severity` per the D-DEC-013 table — NOT ground-truth
   enforcement. Remove the "un-bypassable / hook independently derives severity from raw sensor values / genuinely
   deterministic for severity" language; `native_severity`+`sensor_family` are LLM-supplied, so genuine severity
   ground-truth is **ASM-008-DEFERRED, SYMMETRIC with the asset_type residual**. Cite **VP-HOOK-030** (downgraded to a
   consistency VP; SEVERITY-MISMATCH deny vectors retained; SM-44).
2. **BC-10.01.001 18-field verdict schema + `scored_priority` (field 18) + hard-floor re-key (P11-002 MAJOR).** Inv#9
   field list is now **18 fields** (12 ICD-203 + severity[13] + asset_type[14] + ticket_action_type[15] +
   native_severity[16] + sensor_family[17] + **scored_priority[18]** ∈{CRIT,HIGH,MED,LOW}, the Stage-5 assess-priority
   output). Inv#10 hard floor keys the HIGH/CRIT leg on `verdict.scored_priority`, NOT on recomputed severity (brief
   §3.9 "any alert scored HIGH/CRIT → human"; captures detector-LOW/scored-CRIT KEV/exposure escalations). STEP 1a
   does NOT gate recalibration; verdict.severity and scored_priority may differ. `scored_priority` is LLM-supplied —
   same ASM-008-class residual. Cite **VP-HOOK-025** (field-18 presence/enum) and **VP-HOOK-026** (scored_priority
   floor; detector-LOW/scored-CRIT; SM-46).
3. **BC-3.03.001 / D-DEC-013 NVD/CVSS clean separation (P11-003 MAJOR).** `native_severity`+`sensor_family` always
   describe the ORIGINATING SENSOR's raw reading; NVD/CVSS enrichment influences `scored_priority` (Stage-5), NOT
   `native_severity`; `sensor_family` has no `nvd` member. The pass-10 VP-HOOK-030 CVSS-float STEP-1a vector is
   REMOVED. (PO to remove the "8.5 for NVD CVSS" example from prd-delta field-16 definition — architect §8.25.)
4. **BC-3.03.001 separate human-comment marker path (P11-004 MAJOR).** The 12-field investigation-markdown path does
   NOT enter the verdict emitter; it emits a comment-scoped marker gated ONLY on 12-field completeness + the
   markdown-evaluable hard floors (Indeterminate disposition, forbidden techniques, degraded/silent sensor) — NOT
   `validate_enums()`/STEP 1a. An analyst CAN save a compliant 12-field investigation without being denied. Cite
   **VP-HOOK-031** (new; compliant-save / MARKDOWN-HARD-FLOOR / no-validate_enums-on-markdown vectors; SM-47). PO
   reconciles BC-5.01.001 Inv#7 + BC-4.02.001 PC#4 (the human-path marker) and the BC-3.03.001 Invariant #4 / PC#2
   emitter-entry contradiction per architect §8.24.
5. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md (formal-verifier/PO registration):** register **VP-HOOK-031**
   (FINALIZED P0, next-free 031); DOWNGRADE **VP-HOOK-030** in place to a consistency VP (P11-001, stays FINALIZED P0);
   EXTEND **VP-HOOK-025** (field-18 `scored_priority`) and **VP-HOOK-026** (scored_priority HIGH/CRIT floor, +SM-46).
   Add mutants **SM-46** (highseverity-floor-rekeyed-to-recomputed-severity) and **SM-47**
   (markdown-routed-into-verdict-emitter). Extend the **O6 standing rule** (§0) with the consistency-vs-ground-truth
   residual annotation. VP namespace now VP-SKILL 001–075, VP-HOOK 024–031; SM 9–47 (occupancy re-verified before

   existing VP or SM.

**M. NEW corrections required by this v1.15 (pass-12: command_pattern charset-validation at 5 interpolation sites +
markdown-path four-guarantee redesign + fast-path enum map + known-FP floor exemption + O7 codification;
VP-HOOK-032, SM-48/49/50/51).** The BODY updates — ticket_id/jira_project_key charset-validation before pattern
construction, the Human-Comment Marker Path redesign (autonomy_enabled gate + disposition!=FP route-to-review), the
fast-path SEVERITY_TO_SCORED_PRIORITY_MAP, the known-FP floor exemption + store integrity, and the corrected
D-DEC-001/D-DEC-008 provenance claim — are owned by the product-owner/architect per architecture-delta v1.15
§8.26 (edited in parallel). I do NOT edit the BCs. FV-side cross-references the PO should reflect (post-pass-12
targets, PO-owned; exact numbers reconciled by the dedicated version-coherence sweep):
1. **BC-3.03.001 command_pattern charset-validation at all 5 interpolation sites (P12-001 CRITICAL / O7).** BEFORE
   constructing each `command_pattern`, validate `ticket_id` against `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+$` (STEP 6 comment/assign,
   STEP 3 comment-review, markdown comment path) and `jira_project_key` against `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$` (STEP 3
   create-review, STEP 6 create); on mismatch write `TICKET-ID-CHARSET-DENY` / `PROJECT-KEY-CHARSET-DENY` + emit deny;
   regex-escape as defense-in-depth. Cite **VP-HOOK-032** (the O7 compliance artifact; SM-48 ticket_id, SM-49
   jira_project_key). Correct the false D-DEC-001/D-DEC-008 "never derived from Jira ticket content / never supplied
   by the user" claim — ticket_id IS derived from content; metacharacter safety comes from charset-validation +
   regex-escaping, not a false provenance claim (architect §8.26.1 items 1/3).
2. **BC-3.03.001 Human-Comment Marker Path four-guarantee redesign (P12-002 CRITICAL).** Add the `autonomy_enabled`
   gate as the FIRST check on the markdown path (absent/≠true → allow-without-marker); add the `disposition != FP` →
   route-to-review rule (create-review/comment-review, NOT an autonomous comment); disposition=FP → comment marker;
   ticket_id charset-validated (P12-001). Correct the VP-HOOK-031 scope annotation in BC-3.03.001 to the four
   guarantees (kill switch / disposition routing / ticket_id charset / masquerade-bypass-removed). Cite **VP-HOOK-031**
   (UPDATED; SM-50 kill-switch, SM-51 disposition-routing). PO reconciles BC-5.01.001 / BC-4.02.001 human-comment path
   consumers (architect §8.26.1 item 2).
3. **BC-10.01.001 fast-path enum map + known-FP floor exemption (P12-003 MAJOR).** field 18: on the known-FP fast-path
   (Stage 5 bypassed), `scored_priority` is set from `NORMALIZE_SEVERITY` output mapped through the canonical
   `SEVERITY_TO_SCORED_PRIORITY_MAP` (CRITICAL→CRIT, MEDIUM→MED, HIGH→HIGH, LOW→LOW); a raw assignment produces
   non-members → validate_enums deny of 30–40% of known-FP volume. EC-009 must state the known-FP fast-path is EXEMPT
   from the §3.9 scored_priority floor when (a) sensor healthy, (b) no forbidden technique, (c) disposition=FP; add
   known-FP store integrity invariants (store NOT LLM-writable; privileged-admin + audit for changes; staleness
   review). Cite **VP-HOOK-025** (fast-path enum-map, no mutant) and **VP-HOOK-026** (floor exemption, no mutant)
   (architect §8.26.2 items 1/2).
4. **P12-004/P12-005/P12-006 (PO-owned, NOT FV).** BC-4.05.001 producer field rename (`priority` IS field 18
   `scored_priority`, §8.26.3); BC-6.01.003 Inv#6 + revision-history mis-anchor "BC-6.01.001 Invariant #12" →
   "Postcondition #12" (§8.26.4); BC-8.02.001 Traceability "org_slug scoping on all prism queries" →
   "on raw per-tenant tables; prism_sensor_health carve-out per Invariant #2" (§8.26.5). These are BC-only reference
   corrections; no FV VP/SM impact.
5. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md (formal-verifier/PO registration):** register **VP-HOOK-032**
   (FINALIZED P0, next-free 032 — the O7 command_pattern interpolation-safety compliance artifact); UPDATE
   **VP-HOOK-031** in place to the P12-002 four-guarantee scope (no new id, +SM-50/SM-51); EXTEND **VP-HOOK-025**
   (fast-path SEVERITY_TO_SCORED_PRIORITY_MAP enum vectors) and **VP-HOOK-026** (known-FP floor exemption). Add mutants
   **SM-48** (ticket_id-charset-validation-removed), **SM-49** (jira_project_key-charset-validation-removed), **SM-50**
   (markdown-kill-switch-gate-removed), **SM-51** (markdown-disposition-route-to-review-removed). Add the **O7 standing
   rule** (§0) — command_pattern / authorization-regex interpolation must be charset-validated to a fixed grammar
   (fail-closed) AND regex-escaped; every interpolation site needs a covering VP with a metacharacter-injection mutant
   (5 command_pattern sites covered by VP-HOOK-032; org_slug audit-only/SAFE). VP namespace now VP-SKILL 001–075,
   VP-HOOK 024–032; SM 9–51 (occupancy re-verified before allocation, Lesson 8:

**N. NEW corrections required by this v1.16 (pass-13: MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH elimination + strict parse grammar +
historical-total annotation + PRISMDEMO sweep; VP-HOOK-031 UPDATED in place, SM-52/SM-53).** The BODY updates —
MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH elimination (the markdown path issues NO autonomous comment marker for any disposition;
FP→allow-without-marker; non-FP/PARSE_FAIL→review), the strict `parse_disposition_from_markdown` /
`parse_autonomy_enabled_from_markdown` grammar, the PC#2 prose update, the demo-key rename, and the setup-time
jira_project_key validation — are owned by the product-owner/architect per architecture-delta v1.16 §8.28 (edited in
parallel). I do NOT edit the BCs, the brief, or STATE.md. FV-side cross-references the PO should reflect (post-pass-13
targets, PO-owned; exact numbers reconciled by the dedicated version-coherence sweep):
1. **BC-3.03.001 MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH ELIMINATED (P13-001 CRITICAL / architecture-delta §8.28.1).** The markdown
   (Human-Comment) path MUST NEVER issue an autonomous `["comment"]` marker for ANY disposition. After the
   markdown-evaluable floors pass: `parsed_disposition == FP` → allow-without-marker (Write succeeds, no Jira action,
   no comment marker); ELSE (non-FP/PARSE_FAIL) → create-review/comment-review (MARKDOWN-HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE deny if
   no ticket_id and no jira_project_key; kill-switch-exempt). Update the VP-HOOK-031 scope annotation in BC-3.03.001 to
   guarantee (c) REWRITTEN — "no disposition yields an autonomous comment marker; FP→allow-without-marker;
   non-FP/PARSE_FAIL→review." Cite **VP-HOOK-031** (UPDATED; +SM-52 markdown-fp-comment-marker-revert; SM-50/SM-51
   remain valid with shifted killer vectors).
2. **BC-3.03.001 strict parse grammar (P13-003 MAJOR / architecture-delta §8.28.1).** `parse_disposition_from_markdown`
   reads ONLY the canonical `Disposition` heading value against the {TP,FP,BTP,Indeterminate}(+long-form) allowlist —
   PARSE_FAIL on ambiguous/negated/multi-valued/empty/missing/embedded-in-code-fence → treated as non-FP (review,
   never allow-without-marker); `parse_autonomy_enabled_from_markdown` reads ONLY a dedicated structured field,
   true only on explicit boolean-true (token in a code fence/evidence block → false). Cite **VP-HOOK-031** adversarial
   parse-grammar vectors + **SM-53** (markdown-disposition-full-document-substring-scan).
3. **BC-3.03.001 Postcondition #2 prose update (P13-004 MINOR / architecture-delta §8.28.1).** PC#2 must be updated to
   reflect GATE 1 kill switch + the no-autonomous-comment routing (post-P13-001); cross-ref updated from '(P11-004)' to
   '(P11-004 / P12-002 / P13-001)'. BC-only reference correction; no FV VP/SM impact.
4. **BC-6.01.001 (activate) + BC-6.01.003 (onboard-customer) setup-time jira_project_key validation (P13-002 CRITICAL /
   architecture-delta §8.28.3/§8.28.4).** Any configured jira_project_key MUST be validated against `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$`
   at setup time (fail-early with a user-facing error) — the demo key is corrected PRISM-DEMO → **PRISMDEMO**. These are
   PO-owned BC + brief edits (the brief PRISMDEMO rename is human-authorized); no FV VP/SM impact beyond the
   verification-delta PRISMDEMO vector-example sweep (done — 17 occurrences).
5. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md (formal-verifier/PO registration):** UPDATE **VP-HOOK-031** in place
   (guarantee (c) rewrite — MARKDOWN_COMMENT_PATH eliminated, P13-001 — + strict parse-grammar adversarial vectors,
   P13-003; no new VP id). Add mutants **SM-52** (markdown-fp-comment-marker-revert) and **SM-53**
   (markdown-disposition-full-document-substring-scan); SM-50/SM-51 remain valid. VP namespace UNCHANGED at

the setup-time `jira_project_key` charset validation on the activate + onboard-customer setup flows, and the
BC-6.01.003 Inv#1 AD-017 VP anchor — are owned by the product-owner per architecture-delta v1.17 §8.30 items
8.30.5/8.30.6 (edited in parallel); state-manager annotates spec-changelog [1.1.0] per §8.30.8. I do NOT edit the BCs,
the brief, prd-delta, spec-changelog, or STATE.md. FV-side cross-references the PO should reflect (post-pass-14
targets, PO-owned; exact numbers reconciled by the dedicated version-coherence sweep):
1. **BC-6.01.001 (activate PC#12/EC-014) + BC-6.01.003 (onboard-customer Inv#6/EC-010) setup-time jira_project_key
   charset validation (P14-002 MAJOR / architecture-delta §8.30.6).** The setup-time charset gate added by P13-002 now
   has a covering VP: **VP-SKILL-076** asserts `activate` AND `onboard-customer` BOTH REJECT a `jira_project_key` not
   matching `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$` at setup time (user-facing error, NO partial-state write, fail-EARLY); a conformant key

   → hyphenated key stored → runtime PROJECT-KEY-CHARSET-DENY / HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE livelock). DISTINCT from
   VP-HOOK-032 (the RUNTIME command_pattern deny — a separate call-site).
2. **BC-6.01.003 Inv#1 / EC-008 AD-017 VP anchor (P14-005 MINOR / architecture-delta §8.30.5).** VP-SKILL-053 was
   repurposed (was onboard-customer AD-017 credential-provisioning → now idempotent-directory-creation), leaving Inv#1/EC-008
   without a covering VP. The onboard-customer AD-017 credential-provisioning acceptance is now anchored by the PO's
   burst-10 BC-6.01.003 Inv#1 anchor (references VP-SKILL-054 pattern inheritance and/or the new VP-SKILL-076 setup-time
   gate). FV records the repurposing on the §2 VP-SKILL-053 / VP-SKILL-057 roster rows (see §2) so the ID-meaning change
   is auditable; no FV VP re-scope beyond the annotation.
3. **VP-repurposing roster annotation (P14-005 MINOR / architecture-delta §8.30.7 — MY doc, done directly).** §2 VP table
   rows annotated inline: **VP-SKILL-053** `[originally: onboard-customer AD-017 credential-provisioning; repurposed pass-14

   repurposed pass-9 / P9-005 → now sensor-metrics naming-compliance (D-DEC-006)]` (sensor-metrics org_slug scoping is moot
   under the D-DEC-005 / P9-005 sensor-health carve-out). state-manager mirrors these on the spec-changelog [1.1.0] VP table
   per §8.30.8 — outside FV's edit scope.
4. **NVD/CVSS sweep (P14-001 propagation — MY doc, done directly).** Confirmed P11-003 already removed VP-HOOK-030's
   CVSS-float STEP-1a vector. Corrected the residual: removed the `CVSS 4.0/7.0/9.0` NORMALIZE_SEVERITY family boundaries
   from VP-SKILL-074 (§2 row + §6 note + §5 BC-10.01.001 row, −2 BATS) and corrected SM-44's stale `(1)–(5)` / `CVSS 9.5+MEDIUM`
   killer-vector reference to `(1)–(4)`. NORMALIZE_SEVERITY is authoritative ONLY over sensor_family ∈ {crowdstrike, armis,
   claroty, cyberint} (P14-001 / D-DEC-013); NVD/CVSS is NOT a sensor_family and feeds `scored_priority` (field 18) at Stage 5,
   NOT `native_severity`. The §6 clean-separation claim is now TRUE. No BC change owed by FV.
5. **VP-INDEX.md + verification-coverage-matrix.md (formal-verifier/PO registration):** ADD **VP-SKILL-076** (setup-time

propagation is a PO/architect-owned text alignment consistent with the
architecture-delta v1.16 body — the schema went 15→17 (P10-001) →**18 fields** (P11-002 `scored_priority`), a
deliberate schema extension, not a drift; STEP 1a's asserted guarantee was re-scoped consistency-only per P11-001;
the command_pattern charset-validation, markdown-path redesign, and fast-path enum map are deterministic

P14-002) and annotates VP-SKILL-053/057 as repurposed (P14-005)**)

disposition. The hook cannot evaluate scored_priority (field 18) / asset_type (field 14) from a 12-field markdown, and
no known-FP store cross-check applies — so P12-002's GATE 1 closed the TP/BTP masquerade but left a residual FP-branch
that granted an unfloored autonomous comment (ADV-F2-P13-001). New routing after the markdown-evaluable floors pass:
**FP → allow-without-marker** (Write succeeds, NO Jira action, NO comment marker; analyst surfaces an FP comment via the
review path or the 18-field verdict flow — P11-004 intent preserved, Write NOT denied); **non-FP (TP/BTP/Indeterminate)

ambiguous/negated/multi-valued/empty/embedded-in-code-fence; `parse_autonomy_enabled_from_markdown` reads ONLY a

`Disposition: FP` inside a code fence→PARSE_FAIL→review; `autonomy_enabled: true` in an evidence block→gate CLOSED. Paired

**(1) [P12-001 CRITICAL — regex injection] NEW VP-HOOK-032:** disposition-guard concatenated `ticket_id`/`jira_project_key`
into the anchored `command_pattern` (evaluated by require-review with `[[ =~ ]]`) with NO charset-validation and no
regex-escape (only control-char-stripped for audit), so `ticket_id='.*'` / `'SEC-1 |.*#'` broadened the pattern to
authorize an UNRELATED `jr issue comment` (SEC-009 class; defeats the anchored-match property). Fix: charset-validate
`ticket_id` ↦ `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-[0-9]+$` (STEP 6 comment/assign, STEP 3 comment-review, markdown path) and
`jira_project_key` ↦ `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+$` (STEP 3 create-review, STEP 6 create) → `TICKET-ID-CHARSET-DENY` /
`PROJECT-KEY-CHARSET-DENY` on mismatch, regex-escape as defense-in-depth. VP-HOOK-032 asserts a metacharacter-laden
value is DENIED BEFORE pattern construction at ALL 5 sites + valid values anchor correctly. Paired mutants **SM-48**
(remove ticket_id validation → `.*` authorizes an unrelated comment) and **SM-49** (remove jira_project_key validation).
The false D-DEC-001/D-DEC-008 'never derived from Jira ticket content' claim is corrected (BC-owned). **(2) [P12-002
CRITICAL — markdown-path redesign] VP-HOOK-031 UPDATED (four guarantees):** the Human-Comment Marker Path now (a) reads
`autonomy_enabled` FIRST — absent/≠true → allow-without-marker (no autonomous comment under the kill switch); (b) routes
`disposition != FP` → create-review/comment-review (NOT an autonomous comment — TP/BTP surface to human review); (c)
`disposition=FP` + floors pass → comment marker; (d) charset-validates `ticket_id` (P12-001). Closes the
autonomous-loop-masquerade bypass. Paired mutants **SM-50** (remove kill-switch gate) and **SM-51** (remove
disposition!=FP route-to-review). **(3) [P12-003 MAJOR — enum map + floor exemption] VP-HOOK-025 / VP-HOOK-026
EXTENDED (no mutant):** (a) the known-FP fast-path MUST map `NORMALIZE_SEVERITY` output through
`SEVERITY_TO_SCORED_PRIORITY_MAP` (CRITICAL→CRIT, MEDIUM→MED, HIGH→HIGH, LOW→LOW) — a raw assignment writes a
non-member of SCORED_PRIORITY_ENUM → validate_enums fail-closed deny of 30–40% of known-FP volume (VP-HOOK-025
asserts mapped CRIT/MED pass, raw CRITICAL/MEDIUM deny); (b) a documented known-FP + healthy sensor + non-forbidden
technique + disposition=FP is EXEMPT from the §3.9 scored_priority floor → auto-close (EC-009) even at high native
severity, NOT routed to review (VP-HOOK-026; architectural policy gated on PO confirming the BC-10.01.001 EC-009
floor-exempt annotation + store-integrity invariants). **(4) [P12-007 OBS] O7 standing rule codified (§0):** any value
interpolated into a `command_pattern`/authorization regex MUST be charset-validated (fail-closed) AND regex-escaped;
every interpolation site needs a covering VP with a metacharacter-injection mutant (interpolation audit: 5
command_pattern sites — ticket_id ×3, jira_project_key ×2 — all covered by VP-HOOK-032/SM-48/SM-49; org_slug is
audit-only/SAFE). VP-HOOK-032 is the O7 compliance artifact (mirrors VP-HOOK-024=O5). **(5) Sweep:** no current-body
vector asserts the OLD markdown path (comment marker for any disposition — VP-HOOK-031 vector (a) re-cast to
Disposition: FP) or the OLD fast-path raw scored_priority assignment; the D-DEC-001 'never derived from ticket

NOT `validate_enums()`/STEP 1a — an analyst CAN save a compliant 12-field investigation. Paired mutant **SM-47** (route
the markdown into the verdict emitter) killed by the compliant-save / no-validate_enums vectors. **(5) O6 §0 extended:**

*(Pass-9 record, retained for traceability.)* *F2 Verification Delta v1.12 complete. **31 VPs** (0 collisions, 0 renumbering): VP-SKILL 001–074, VP-HOOK
024–029 (v1.10/v1.11/v1.12 add no new VP — VP-HOOK-029 / VP-HOOK-024 extended in place). **Pass-9 remediation
(P9-001 MAJOR / P9-004 MINOR / P9-007 MINOR / P9-009 OBS, architecture-delta v1.12 §8.21):** **(1) [P9-004 —
MY doc, fixed directly] §2 Totals bookkeeping:** the '8 hook / 23 skill' split label was an internal miscount
— the roster is **6 VP-HOOK (024–029) + 25 VP-SKILL** (050/051, 052–063 [12], 064–074 [11]); corrected to
**6 hook / 25 skill** (grand total 31 unchanged and correct). The §2 Totals lifecycle label 'FINALIZED' for
VP-SKILL-052–063 is reconciled to **ACCEPTED** — the §1 Namespace Adjudication table (authoritative per-VP
lifecycle source absent a VP-INDEX.md) already marked them ACCEPTED (F1-inherited, never re-FINALIZED in F2;
only 050/051 are FINALIZED F1 VPs), so §1 was correct and §2 carried the drift. Both locations now read
ACCEPTED. **(2) [P9-001 MAJOR] VP-HOOK-024 EXTENDED (stays FINALIZED)** with the escaped-quote
differential-vs-bash partition (O5): the P8-002 tokenizer toggled state on every `\"`/`\'` regardless of a
preceding backslash, so with the P8-003 step-5 backstop removed a `\"` inside `--summary` could swallow a REAL
`--label REVIEW-REQUIRED` (fungibility bypass). D-DEC-001 v1.12 makes the tokenizer backslash-aware; three
vectors — 1a (escaped-quote boundary hides a real label → has_review_label=TRUE → DENY, kills SM-43), 1b
(escaped quote inside summary, no real label → ALLOW), partition-2 (`\'` UNQUOTED → literal apostrophe, no
IN_SINGLE swallow → DENY on the trailing real label). Paired mutant **SM-43** (revert the IN_DOUBLE
backslash handling to P8-002 toggle-on-every-quote), separately killable from SM-40/SM-42. **Equals-form
`--label=VALUE` SCOPED OUT** — jr CLI has no equals form (confirmed 2026-07-21). **(3) [P9-007 MINOR]
VP-HOOK-029 EXTENDED (stays FINALIZED P0)** with a test-only dedup-before-fallback vector (the STEP-3
comment-review→create-review fallback hint requires a §3.4 dedup re-run confirming no open
BLIND-SPOT/REVIEW-REQUIRED ticket before switching; a dedup HIT must NOT produce a duplicate create-review,
D-DEC-004) — NO mutant (deny-reason text, not a control-flow security path; loop-side protection discharged by
VP-SKILL-068). **(4) [P9-009 OBS] O5 standing rule codified (§0)** — any hook re-implementing shell
tokenization for a security decision MUST carry a differential-vs-bash vector partition over all shell-quoting
classes the downstream CLI honors, with paired mutants; VP-HOOK-024 is the O5 compliance artifact for
`structural_label_check` (single/double via P8-002, unquoted + backslash-escape via P9-001). Namespace (Lesson
8): SM-42 was max real (SM-2026 a date false-positive), SM-P9-A → **SM-43** (next free, confirmed absent
repo-wide). **37 SM-N mutants (SM-9..SM-43)** — all on the CRITICAL disposition-guard/require-review
authorization path (≥95%); the step-6a family is now SM-36/37/40/42/43. **~188 new BATS + ~84 parity ≈ ~272**

*(Pass-8 record, retained for traceability.)* *F2 Verification Delta v1.11 complete. **31 VPs** (0 collisions, 0 renumbering): VP-SKILL 001–074,
VP-HOOK 024–029 (v1.10/v1.11 add no new VP — VP-HOOK-029 extended in place, VP-HOOK-024 / VP-SKILL-074 extended).
**Pass-8 remediation (P8-001 CRITICAL / P8-002 MAJOR / P8-003 MINOR, architecture-delta v1.11 §8.19):**
**(1) [P8-001 CRITICAL] VP-HOOK-029 EXTENDED (stays FINALIZED P0 — additive, NOT a re-scope)** with the
STEP-3 correctly-labeled-yet-unbindable sub-case: the redesigned D-DEC-008 STEP 3 replaces the two silent
`emit allow without marker` branches (create-review + null `jira_project_key`; comment-review + null
`ticket_id`) with a **`HARD-FLOOR-UNBINDABLE` DENY-THE-WRITE** per D-DEC-012 clause 2 — three new vectors
(create-review + null project_key → deny + audit naming `missing_field`; comment-review + null ticket_id +
create-review fallback hint; comment-review + both null → deny naming both); NEVER a silent allow-without-marker.
Paired mutant **SM-41** (revert the STEP-3 create-review null-binding branch to emit-allow-without-marker),
separately killable from SM-38. **(2) [P8-002 MAJOR] VP-HOOK-024** step-6a false-deny vector updated to the
QUOTED form (the P7-005 `split_on_whitespace` still false-denies EC-024's own example; the D-DEC-001
quote-aware UNQUOTED/IN_SINGLE/IN_DOUBLE tokenizer keeps a quoted `--summary` value as one token → ALLOW) +
paired **SM-42** (revert to non-quote-aware `split_on_whitespace`), separately killable from SM-40 (documented
distinction). **(3) [P8-003 MINOR] EC-023 step-5 correction:** bash `[[ =~ ]]` is NOT tail-anchored — the
regular create pattern PASSES step 5 for a review-labeled create; anti-fungibility direction A is enforced
EXCLUSIVELY at step 6a (`structural_label_check`), the SOLE, load-bearing enforcement point — so the
SM-36/37/40/42 step-6a mutant family is P0-adjacent/non-redundant (SM-36/37 remain CRITICAL). No
verification-delta current-body step-5-defense-in-depth claim needed retraction (the false claim lives in
BC-3.01.001 EC-023, PO-owned §8.18). **Stale sweep:** the STEP-3 'allow without marker' missing-binding
behavior was never a current-body assertion here. Namespace (Lesson 8): SM-40 was max real (SM-2026 a date
false-positive), SM-P8-A/B → **SM-41/SM-42** (next free). **36 SM-N mutants (SM-9..SM-42)** — all on the
CRITICAL disposition-guard/require-review authorization path (≥95%). **~184 new BATS + ~83 parity ≈ ~267**
test cases (was ~263; net +3 BATS — VP-HOOK-029 unbindable-deny +3 on BC-10.01.001; VP-HOOK-024 quoted-form is
an UPDATE of the SM-40 vector, +0). Live-BC post-pass-8 (version-coherence sweep applied burst-4): **BC-3.01.001 v1.20, BC-3.03.001 v1.17,
BC-10.01.001 v1.13**. FV cross-references routed to PO in §7 Part I. input-hash: COMPUTE-AT-COMMIT.*

*(Pass-7 record, retained for traceability.)* **Pass-7 remediation (ADV-F2-P7-001/004/005/006/009, architecture-delta v1.10 §8.17):** the CENTRAL change
is that the STEP-4 marker-UPGRADE mechanism (P5-001/P6-002) is **RETIRED** and replaced by
**DENY-THE-WRITE** — P7-001 CRITICAL proved the upgrade unsound (disposition-guard can rewrite the marker
but not the loop's future Bash command → 3 of 4 under-label action types produced an unconsumable marker and
a silently-dropped finding). **(1) [P7-001/P7-004 — O4]** **VP-HOOK-029 re-scoped END-TO-END** (emitter-only
"marker OR error" → CONSUMER-BOUNDARY jr authorization/execution outcome per the O4 standing rule §0):
re-marked PROPOSED then **re-FINALIZED P0**. New property — hard-floor verdict with ANY `ticket_action_type`:
(review token) → marker at STEP 3 AND a correctly-labeled jr write authorized/consumable at consumer STEP 6a;
(non-review token incl. `none`) → verdict Write **DENIED** at STEP 4 with a structured corrective reason
(`hard_floor_trigger`/`required_token`/`label_instruction`) + **UNDER-LABEL-DENIED** audit — NEVER an
unconsumable marker, NEVER a silent allow. **RETIRED** the three v1.9 STEP-4 upgrade-marker vectors + the
UNDER-LABEL-CORRECTED audit assertion (reason "mechanism removed ADV-F2-P7-001"; history preserved).
**Added** deny-path vectors (create/assign/none under-label deny+audit; corrected-rewrite happy path;
consumer-boundary consumable/unconsumable; kill-switch-irrelevance — deny fires with `autonomy_enabled` BOTH
true and false, STEP 4 before STEP 5). **(2) Mutants (occupancy re-verified, Lesson 8 — SM-37 was max real,
SM-2026 a date false-positive): SM-38** (step4-deny-removed → silent allow; killed by the deny-path vectors),
**SM-39** (deny-corrective-reason-removed → deny fires but the loop cannot act; killed by the
machine-actionable-reason vector); **SM-32a RE-TARGETED** (revert the deny to the retired GOTO-WRITE_MARKER
upgrade → unconsumable in-store marker; killed by the consumer-boundary vector); **SM-32-ext** kill vector
RE-WORDED to the deny-before-kill-switch assertion. **(3) [P7-005 MINOR]** **VP-HOOK-024** step-6a
`structural_label_check` false-deny-prevention vector (regular create with a `--label REVIEW-REQUIRED`
literal inside `--summary` → ALLOW) + paired **SM-40** (raw-substring revert). **(4) [P7-006 MINOR]**
**VP-SKILL-074** Cyberint partition (3 vectors — any Cyberint native severity → CRITICAL pre-ASM-008
conservative default; never LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH pre-ASM-008; CRITICAL carries uncertainty_explicit; "update when
ASM-008 resolves"). **(5) [P7-009 OBS]** **O4 standing rule codified (§0)** — emitter-local artifacts never
suffice as evidence for a consumer-boundary guarantee. STEP-4-upgrade / UNDER-LABEL-CORRECTED / marker-in-store
fail-loud phrasing swept to deny-the-Write throughout (SM catalog / VP rows / §3/§6 notes / §7 Part H /
this snapshot); VP-SKILL-065's regular-vs-review carve-out phrasing UNCHANGED. **34 SM-N mutants
(SM-9..SM-40, SM-32 = SM-32a + SM-32b + SM-32-ext)** — all on the CRITICAL disposition-guard/require-review
authorization path (≥95%). **~181 new BATS + ~82 parity ≈ ~263** test cases estimated for F3 sizing (was
~258; net +3 BATS — BC-3.01.001 step-6a false-deny +1; BC-10.01.001 VP-HOOK-029 deny-the-Write re-scope
