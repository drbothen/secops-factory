## Decisions Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Phase | Date | Made By |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| D-001 | Onboarding depth = Phase 0 only; park at 0-complete awaiting feature-request | Internal dev-tooling plugin; no active feature scope yet | pre-0 | 2026-07-19 | human |
| D-002 | market-intelligence SKIPPED | Internal dev-tooling plugin — no market research needed | pre-0 | 2026-07-19 | human |
| D-003 | design-system-extraction SKIPPED | No UI surfaces in this plugin | pre-0 | 2026-07-19 | human |

## Skip Log

| Step | Skipped? | Justification |
|------|----------|---------------|
| UX Spec | yes | CLI/agent plugin — no UI surfaces |
| Market Intelligence | yes | Internal dev-tooling plugin; no external market |
| Design System Extraction | yes | Internal dev-tooling plugin; no UI |
